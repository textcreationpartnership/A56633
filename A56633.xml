            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> ſignifies, <hi>going out,</hi> or, <hi>departing</hi> from one Place to another. It contains an Hiſtory of about an <hi>hundred forty and five</hi> years (ſome make it <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> years leſs) from the Death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to the Building of the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> For it treats of ſeveral Things which went before their <hi>Departure;</hi> and which followed after it: but they all relate to that, and depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>Now theſe are the Names of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>which came into</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Being to relate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60246:5"/>the Departure of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was very proper firſt to ſet down, the Number of thoſe who came into it; and the Heads of them: Whereby it might the better appear alſo how God had fulfilled his Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of multiplying his Seed: Which <hi>Moſes</hi> had recorded in his firſt Book (<hi>Geneſis</hi>) where he ſhows this Promiſe was made at that very time, when he declared, after a long Affliction in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would conduct his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity into <hi>Canaan,</hi> XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 5, 13, 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> &amp;c.]. He doth not ſet down their Names (in theſe three Verſes) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Birth: but firſt the Children of <hi>Leah;</hi> then one of <hi>Rachels;</hi> and then thoſe of his Handmaids; and laſt of all (in the next Verſes) <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi> who was in <hi>Egypt</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And all the Souls.</hi>] i. e. Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who came out of the Loins.</hi>] In the Hebrew, out of <hi>the thigh,</hi> which ſignifies that part whereby Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is propagated: as was obſerved upon XLVI <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. And ſo the Author of the <hi>Tripartite</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſes the word <hi>femur,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of <hi>Benjamin</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves, P. 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Joſeph <hi>was in</hi> Egypt <hi>already.</hi>] In the Hebrew the Particle <hi>Vau</hi> (which we commonly tranſlate <hi>and,</hi> and here <hi>for</hi>) ſometimes alſo ſignifies <hi>with.</hi> See IV <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. And ſo it doth in this place: which ſhould be tranſlated <hi>ſeventy Souls, with</hi> Joſeph; <hi>who was in</hi> Egypt <hi>already.</hi> For <hi>Joſeph</hi> is not to be added to the LXX, but reckoned among them; to make up that number: as appears from XLVI <hi>Gen.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60246:5"/>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> Joſeph <hi>died.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all his Brethren, and all that Generation.</hi>] All that came with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were fruitful,</hi> &amp;c.] Here are ſeveral words for the ſame thing; to ſhow their extraordinary Increaſe, beyond what was uſual in that or any other Country. And becauſe there are ſix words in all, to expreſs this great Increaſe, ſome of the Hebrews conclude they brought forth ſix Children at a Birth. Which others of them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſecond word here uſed <hi>Jiſchretzu:</hi> which is a word whereby the Increaſe of Fiſhes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in I <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. So <hi>Theodorick Hacſpan</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Baal-hatturim</hi> and <hi>Jalkut,</hi> and thinks the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not to be rejected, becauſe they bring fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Conceits to ſupport it. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith (<hi>L.</hi> VII. <hi>Hiſtor. Animal. c.</hi> 4.) the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Women were ſo fruitful, that ſome of them at four Births brought <hi>Twenty</hi> Children. No wonder then, if ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought <hi>Six</hi> at a time, by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Bleſſing of God upon them. For <hi>Caſpar Schottus</hi> names the Wife of a Citizen in <hi>Florence,</hi> who had <hi>Two and fifty Children,</hi> and never brought leſs than <hi>Three at a Birth,</hi> L. III. Phyſ. Curioſae, Cap. XXIX. where he hath collected a vaſt number of Examples of ſuch ſtrange fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>But no Body hath explained this Verſe now more ſoberly and unexceptionably than <hi>Abarbinel;</hi> who conſiders every one of the words here uſed, very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly; and ſhows they are not multiplyed in vain. For as the firſt word,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were fruitful.</hi>] Signifies, he thinks, that none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them were barren; but brought forth every year, as Trees are wont to do. So the next word,</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60246:6"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And increaſed abundantly.</hi>] Signifies, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brought forth more than One at a time, as <hi>creeping</hi> things do; to which this word alludes. And becauſe, when more than one are born at a Birth, they are frequently very weak, and not long lived; Therefore he adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And multiplied.</hi>] Which ſignifies, that they grew up to be Men and Women; and lived to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their own. And thoſe not feeble, but luſty and ſtrong; as the next words, he thinks, imports, <hi>waxed exceeding mighty:</hi> of which more preſently.</p>
               <p>Now this vaſt Increaſe began at their firſt coming into <hi>Egypt,</hi> XLVII <hi>Gen.</hi> 27, 28. and ſo continued till the death of all that Generation, mentioned in the foregoing Verſe. When it began to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> who thought it might prove dangerous to them. For the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied exceedingly,</hi> during the ſpace of XVII years, that <hi>Jacob</hi> lived in <hi>Egypt;</hi> there is no doubt they increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed proportionably in the ſpace of LIV years more, which <hi>Joſeph</hi> lived after the death of his Father. And ſo in LXIV years more, from the Death of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the Birth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt needs be grown ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as to <hi>fill the Country.</hi> So that in LXXX years more, they were increaſed to <hi>Six hundred thouſand Men beſides Children,</hi> XII <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. And the next year their Number being taken, they were found to be <hi>Six hundred and three thouſand, five hundred and fifty Men,</hi> from Twenty years old and upward; as we read I <hi>Numb.</hi> 45, 46. And therefore reckoning Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Children, and Youths under the Age of <hi>Twenty;</hi> we cannot but think they were <hi>three</hi> times as many: or perhaps <hi>Two Millions.</hi> Which is not incredible, by a moderate Computation, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60246:6"/>how many might ſpring from LXX Perſons, in the ſpace of <hi>Two hundred and fifteen years</hi> (which the fore-named Sums make) as <hi>Bonfrerius,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others from him in our own Language, have been at the pains to demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And waxed exceeding mighty.</hi>] This is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to ſignifie, that they were not only nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but robuſt and ſtrong. And it may as well denote, that their vaſt Numbers made them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Formidable to the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> who began, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Sequel, to be jealous of their <hi>power,</hi> if they ſhould have a <hi>will</hi> to attempt any thing againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Land was filled with them.</hi>] i. e. The Land of <hi>Goſhen;</hi> and perhaps ſome other Parts of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Now there aroſe up a New King over</hi> Egypt.] Some by a <hi>New King</hi> underſtand a King of another Family, or Race (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> interprets it) nay, a Stranger, of another Nation: juſt as, <hi>New Gods</hi> are ſtrange Gods, in Scripture Language. Thus Sir <hi>John Marſham;</hi> and then it is no wonder, that he knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as it here follows. But this is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: and the Conceit whereby <hi>Eben Ezra</hi> juſtifies it (which is, that the word <hi>roſe up</hi> implies as much) is juſtly cenſured by <hi>Abarbinel</hi> as frivolous: it being the common word, which is uſed every where, when a new King ſucceeds his Predeceſſor. It is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore that <hi>Moſes</hi> means no more, but that the King in whoſe time <hi>Joſeph</hi> died, being dead likewiſe (whom many take to have been <hi>Mephramuthoſis</hi>) and another after him, whom they call <hi>Thutmoſis;</hi> the next Succeſſor in the Throne <hi>(Amenophis)</hi> either had heard nothing of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> or did not mind what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60246:7"/>was ſaid of him. Our great Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> gives a different account of the Succeſſion of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings; and takes this King to have been <hi>Ramaſſes Miamum:</hi> but ſtill ſuppoſes him to have been of the old Line, and not a Stranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who knew not</hi> Joſeph.] There is no doubt that <hi>Joſeph</hi> died, as he lived, in high Eſteem and great Reputation in that Country: and that his Memory continued precious, as long as any of that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laſted. For <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith (L. I.) that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> above all other People, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But we need go no further for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this than the very next Chapter to this, (II <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.) where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to <hi>water their Flock,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Daughters, and the word for <hi>their</hi> is of the Maſculine Gender. It agrees alſo beſt with the whole ſtory, to take it ſo here; that God
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60246:12"/>made the Midwives Houſes, (ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and the LXX underſtand it) that is, gave them a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Offspring, out of which aroſe many <hi>Families,</hi> which in Scripture Language are called <hi>Houſes,</hi> XXX <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. <hi>When ſhall I make my ſelf an Houſe?</hi> (the ſame Phraſe with this) <hi>i. e.</hi> take care of my own Family, XXV <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. IV <hi>Ruth</hi> 5. Or elſe the meaning may be, <hi>he increaſed their Eſtate,</hi> and gave them great Riches: which the Pſalmiſt may be thought to mean, when he ſaith, <hi>Except the Lord build the Houſe,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> preſerve and increaſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of a Family) their labour is in vain that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it. See alſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 11. CXIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. Some that take theſe Midwives to have been <hi>Egyptian</hi> Women, proſelyted to the Jewiſh Religion, think the ſenſe may be, that they married to <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and God made their Families eminent in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>charged all his People, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every Son,</hi> &amp;c.] Not being able to effect his end by the Midwives, he commanded every Body to inform his Officers when any Hebrew Woman fell in Labour, and appointed Searchers (it's likely) to examine whether they were delivered of Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and to act according to what is here ordered. Some that underſtand the foregoing words of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> make this the ſenſe of the two laſt Verſes: <hi>Becauſe the Midwives feared God, and thereby the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Iſraelites were increaſed, not diminiſhed;</hi> Pharaoh <hi>took a new Courſe, and charged all his People to ſee that done, which the Midwives refuſed.</hi> The Jews (in the Book called <hi>The Life of</hi> Moſes) ſay that many of their People, upon this Decree of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> reſolved not to marry, or not to come near their Wives: and thoſe who did, were forced
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60246:12"/>to have them brought to Bed alone, and throw their Children into the Fields, where the Angels took care of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is confuted by what follows in the next Chapter. And yet they are ſo fond of ſuch Fables, that in one of their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſchim</hi> (or Books of Homilies) they ſay, God made Milk to come out of one Stone, and Honey out of another, to Suckle them, while they lay hid in the Earth.

XXVI <hi>Numb.</hi> 59.

See <hi>Selden, L.</hi> V. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 9. The Jews alſo, fancying his Mother <hi>Jochabed</hi> to have been born as ſoon as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> make the Birth of <hi>Moſes</hi> a Miracle: becauſe ſhe muſt be, by that account, an <hi>Hundred and thirty</hi> years old, when he was born.

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60246:13"/>and but his half Siſter.

                  </gap>, which is proper to Sacred Cleanſing.

And in <hi>Pirke Elieſer,</hi> Cap.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60246:15"/>that ſhe went into the River to <hi>purge her ſelf from the Idolatry of her Father's Houſe:</hi> i. e. to become a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte,</hi> who was received (in following times) into the Jewiſh Religion by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And her Maidens walkt along by the Rivers ſide.</hi>] While ſhe waſhed her ſelf, in a private place, which, no doubt, was made by the King for that purpoſe. For it is not to be imagined, that ſhe waſhed herſelf publickly in the River; but in ſome Incloſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe was ſeparated from the ſight of Company. For <hi>Zoan</hi> (or <hi>Tanis</hi>) the Royal City, it is certain, lay near the River; and it is likely the King's Gardens extended themſelves to the very Banks of it: where convenient <hi>Bathing-Houſes</hi> were contrived for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Royal Family, to bathe in the River when they pleaſed. <hi>Patricides</hi> ſeems to ſay, that the River ran through the City, or by the ſide of it: for ſo the words are; <hi>The Ark was put in the banks of the River</hi> Nile, <hi>where the water was ſhalloweſt, in the City of</hi> Tzana, <hi>which was the Metropolis of that part of the Country.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Elmacinus,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arabian</hi> Writer, as <hi>Hottinger</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Smegma Orientale, L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 400.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when ſhe ſaw the Ark among the flaggs.</hi>] In ſuch a Bathing-Houſe, as I ſuppoſe her to have now been, there were <hi>Latices</hi> through which ſhe could ſee what was done in the River, though no Body could ſee her. And ſhe ſpying an unuſual Veſſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſlags, commanded it to be brought to her. <hi>Patricides</hi> ſaith, ſhe heard the Child cry. And <hi>Chuskuni</hi> obſerves, it was more eaſie for her who was in the River, to eſpy the Ark, than for her Maidens who walked above upon the Banks.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſent her Maid to fetch it.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Amatha,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Maid,</hi> is much different from that for <hi>Maidens</hi> mention'd juſt before: ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying one that waited immediately upon her, whom we call an <hi>Handmaid;</hi> the other properly ſignifying only young Women; who were ſuch, perhaps, as we now call <hi>Ladies of Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And when ſhe had opened it, ſhe ſaw the Child.</hi>] And together with him the SCHECHINAH or Divine Majeſty, as <hi>Rabbi Joſe</hi> ſaith in <hi>Sota:</hi> which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their opinion, who make her to be now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted; but hath no other foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And behold the Babe wept.</hi>] There is nothing ſtrange in this, that a Babe (which perhaps had been a good while without the Breaſt) ſhould weep: but it is remarkable, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter ſhould not find it, till tears ran down its Cheeks; becauſe this helpt to move her <hi>compaſſion</hi> towards it, as it here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhe had Compaſſion on him.</hi>] Reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, contrary to her Father's Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid, this is one of the Hebrew's Children.</hi>] None elſe, ſhe thought, would expoſe ſo goodly a Child: and ſhe was confirm'd in her opinion, when ſhe found he was Circumciſed, as the ſame <hi>R. Joſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures. And the truth is, we have no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had, as yet, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Then ſaid his Siſter to</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Daughter,</hi> &amp;c.] We cannot think his Siſter would be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to ſtep in immediately, upon the finding of the Child, and ask if ſhe ſhould call a Hebrew Nurſe for it: but ſtaid ſome time (that ſhe might not ſeem to know any thing of him, but what ſhe

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Daughter ſaid unto her, Go.</hi>] It is likely that <hi>Miriam</hi> addreſſed her ſelf to her ſo diſcreetly, that it moved her eaſily to agree to her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Though a ſingular Providence of God guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this whole buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Maid went and called this Child's Mother.</hi>] Whoſe Breaſt the Child readily taking (having been uſed to it) ſhe was inſtantly accepted to be his Nurſe. So it follows in the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Take this Child away, and Nurſe it for me,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus by the wonderful Providence of God, <hi>Jochabed</hi> had the pleaſure of ſuckling her own Child; and was alſo well paid for her pains.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And the Child grew, and ſhe brought him unto</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter.</hi>] The Hebrew Writers ſay, that when he was <hi>Two</hi> years old, he was taken from her: which is not ſo likely, as that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with her till he was grown capable to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in true Religion, and to underſtand and remember whoſe true Child he was; whereby he was diſpoſed to behave himſelf accordingly, when he came to live at Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he became her Son.</hi>] She having no Child of her own, adopted him for her Son, with the conſent, no doubt, of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Not to ſucceed in the Throne, as ſome have fancied; but to be the Heir of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Eſtate. And accordingly ſhe gave him a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Education, and took care he ſhould be inſtructed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60246:16"/>in all <hi>the Wiſdom of the Egyptians,</hi> as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> hath remembred, VII <hi>Acts</hi> 22. and, as <hi>Philo</hi> (in <hi>The Life of</hi> Moſes) would have it believed, ſent for the ableſt Maſters out of <hi>Greece</hi> (as well as out of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and other Eaſtern Countries) to teach him their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which is a piece of Jewiſh Vanity; for there was no Learning among the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the days of <hi>Moſes:</hi> who was ancienter, not only than their <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> but than moſt of their Gods, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> demonſtrates; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>And ſhe ſaid, becauſe I have drawn him out of the Water.</hi>] This Name ſeems to be derived from the Hebrew word <hi>Maſhah,</hi> which is never uſed in the Bible, but for drawing out of the Water, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXII. 17. XVIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. LXIII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need to have recourſe to any other Language for the original of his Name; which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> will have to be derived from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Tongue, they ſay, ſignifies <hi>Water,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>ſaved.</hi> So that it is as much, as <hi>ſaved from the Waters,</hi> or preſerved from drowning. It may be ſaid indeed, that it is not likely ſhe would give him a Name from any other Language than her own: but it is to be conſidered, that the word <hi>Maſhah</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60246:17"/>(from whence this Name moſt naturally flows, and to which ſhe her ſelf ſaid ſhe had reſpect) might have the ſame ſignification in her Language, that it had in Hebrew; there being a great affinity between theſe two Tongues. See XL <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. <hi>Clem. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> ſaith, that the Name he had given him by his Parents at his Circumciſion was <hi>Joachim.</hi> Which he had, I ſuppoſe, out of ſome fabulous Book; for, in the ſame place, he ſpeaks of the Name was given him after he was tranſlated to Heaven, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Strom. p.</hi> 343.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe days when Moſes was grown.</hi>] When he was not only arrived at Man's eſtate, but was full <hi>Forty</hi> years old, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> obſerves, (VII <hi>Acts</hi> 23.) and may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he went out unto his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] He had a motion from God (as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> there ſeems to interpret it) to go, and acquaint himſelf with the Condition of his Brethren; and to own himſelf, more than he had done hitherto, to be one of them. The Jews tell many Tales what paſſed between him and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> till this time; but there is no more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be given to them, than to what <hi>Artapanus,</hi> an Heathen Hiſtorian, relates of his Military Exploits in a War with the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Cene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phres</hi> ſent him as General of his Forces: Though this is remarkable, that his Name and ſeveral Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Life (mixed with ſome Fables) were known to other Nations, and by them magnified and admired. As appears by what <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Artapanus, Eupolemus, Demetrius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heathen Writers, <hi>L.</hi> IX. <hi>Praepar. Evang. c.</hi> 26, 27, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60246:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And looked upon their burdens.</hi>] Which he did very often, (as <hi>Philo</hi> underſtands it, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Vita Moſis</hi>) and not without great Grief and Heavineſs; that he was neither able to hinder their Oppreſſion, nor to help them under it. But he exhorted <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Officers to moderate their Severity; and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be patient, in hope of Deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſpied an Egyptian, ſmiting an Hebrew.</hi>] The Cauſe of it is reported (in <hi>The Life of</hi> Moſes, in Hebrew, and in <hi>Schalſch Hakkabalah</hi>) that this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> had broken the <hi>Hebrew</hi>'s Houſe, and bound him, and raviſhed his Wife, and now endeavoured to murder him. But this looks like a Tale: which is a little better told by the Author of <hi>Schemoth Rabba,</hi> and others mentioned by Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 1. who ſay, that this <hi>Egyptian</hi> was one of the Taskmaſters, who called this Man out of his Bed in the Night, to go to work, and then took his opportunity to ſlip into it, and lye with <hi>Selo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith</hi> his Wife, who took him for her Husband. The plaineſt account and moſt likely, is this of <hi>Philo</hi> (in the place above mentioned) that ſome of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Officers, little differing from the moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beaſts, not at all mollified, but more exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Intreaties; one of them, of the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper, fell in an outragious manner upon an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe he did not do his work ſo faſt as he would have him, beating him moſt cruelly till he had almoſt kill'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One of his Brethren.</hi>] All the Hebrews were his Brethren; but this Man, was of his own Tribe, and one of the Children of <hi>Kohath,</hi> as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Authors take it.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60246:18"/>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he looked this way and that way,</hi> &amp;c.] Round about him; that he might not run into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger himſelf, by delivering his Brother from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſlew the Egyptian.</hi>] Being ſtirred up to it, by a Divine motion: otherways he could not have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified this Fact, to God and his own Conſcience. And therefore St. <hi>Stephen</hi> plainly makes this an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God intended to deliver them by his means; and ſays, <hi>Moſes</hi> thought they would have ſo underſtood it, VII <hi>Acts</hi> 25. Nay, <hi>Maimonides</hi> himſelf gives this account of it, (<hi>Pars</hi> II. <hi>Cap.</hi> XLV. <hi>More Nevochim</hi>) where, he making this the firſt Degree of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> when a Man is moved and animated by God to ſome great and heroick Enterpriſe (either for the Preſervation of the whole Church, or the Deliverance of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men from Oppreſſion) he reckons <hi>Moſes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, as an Inſtance of it, in theſe words: <hi>Moſes was indued with this Power, when he grew up to be a Man; by the impulſe of which he ſlew the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and checked him who unjuſtly ſtrove with one of his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. The Hebrews generally ſay that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did not kill this Man with a Sword, or any other Weapon, but meerly by the word of his Mouth, pronouncing him Dead in the Name of God. Which Tradition is ſo old, that it is mentioned by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, L.</hi> I. <hi>Strom.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. They that pretend to Secrets, ſay, that he killed the Egyptian with his word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as <hi>Peter</hi> afterwards, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> killed <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And hid him in the Sand.</hi>] An inacceſſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert lay on the Weſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> obſerves; and there was another alſo on the Eaſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60246:18"/>of it: ſo that if this hapned upon the Borders, there was Sand enough wherein to bury him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And when he went out the ſecond day.</hi>] Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun to Act by the Divine Commiſſion, he ſeems to have reſolved every day to give proofs of his Authority; and awaken the People to expect deliverance by his means. And therefore went out, among them, this day, as he had done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, Two Men of the Hebrews ſtrove together.</hi>] He was ſurprized to find two of his Brethren con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending one with another; when they were ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly oppreſſed by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaid to him that did the wrong, Wherefore ſmiteſt thou thy fellow?</hi>] He had no leſs Authority to admoniſh and reprove his Brethren, than to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe their Oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And he ſaid, Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us?</hi>] It is plain by this that he acted as one that had Authority; but this Man queſtioned from whence he had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi>] It is not likely the Man thought he had any ſuch intention; but meant only to fright <hi>Moſes</hi> from medling in his matters, by letting him know that what he had done already, was not ſuch a ſecret as he thought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>feared.</hi>] He had not yet received a Commiſſion from God to act publickly as their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and therefore durſt not ſtay to anſwer a Charge againſt him (which he thought might be poſſibly brought) for what he had done privately. Some have troubled themſelves to reconcile this with what the Apoſtle ſaith, XI <hi>Hebr.</hi> 27. that <hi>he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60246:19"/>feared not the wrath of the King;</hi> which doth not ſeem to agree with what is ſaid here, that <hi>Moſes fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But there he may very well be thought to ſpeak, not of his flight out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but of his laſt departure with the whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Though if we ſhould allow <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Apoſtle, to ſpeak of the ſame thing, there would be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between them. For he might ſo fear, as to make him cautious, and conſult for his Safety; rather than baſely either deny, or excuſe what he had done, or ask pardon for it; unto which no <hi>fear of the wrath of the King</hi> could have moved him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Now when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>heard this thing.</hi>] Which was ſoon brought to his ears, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: and aggravated extreamly by the great Men of the Court, as <hi>Philo</hi> repreſents it, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Vita Moſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He thought to ſlay him.</hi>] Not ſo much becauſe he had killed the Man, as becauſe he pretended to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Liberty of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to be their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. <hi>Demetrius</hi> bears witneſs to this Story, juſt according to what is here related, in <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. Evang. L.</hi> IX. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>fled from the face of</hi> Pharaoh.] Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſeeing the Danger, he avoided it by flight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Country, where he was out of his reach. For though the time of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Deliverance was not yet come, he was aſſured, that God intended to work it by his hand: and therefore thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to reſerve himſelf till he received a further Commiſſion from God. But though this flight of <hi>Moſes</hi> be here ſo plainly affirmed, yet the Jews are ſo ſond of their own Conceits, and ſo bold in their Invention, that they ſay he was not only condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60246:19"/>to have his Head cut off, but brought to the Block; and when the Executioner came to do his Office, his Sword would not enter; <hi>Moſes</hi> his Neck being, by a Miracle, turned into a Pilaſter of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and from thence called his Son <hi>Eliezer,</hi> &amp;c. So the Tale is told by the Author of <hi>Moſes his Life.</hi> What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> this was is not certain; but <hi>Euſebius</hi> calls him <hi>Orus</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Amenophis,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Moſes</hi> was born) and he is ſaid to have reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Two and forty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And dwelt in the Land of</hi> Midian.] Where ſome of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity were ſetled (XXV <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.) in a part of <hi>Arabia Petraea.</hi> And therefore <hi>Philo</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſat down by a Well.</hi>] To refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and expecting, it's likely, to meet ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there, at the time when the Flocks came to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

For the word <hi>Cohen</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſignifies either <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Prince:</hi> but moſt anciently it ſignifies the latter (a <hi>Prince</hi>) For ſo it is uſed in the Book of <hi>Job</hi> XII. 19.

And it may be moſt truly rendred, <hi>a Prince</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> one of the Princes, or Rulers) of <hi>Midian.</hi> But in ancient time Princes executed the Prieſthood alſo, as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerves they did among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and the Conſuls and Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> were ambitious of the ſame Dignity: by which means the word <hi>Cohen</hi> came to ſignifie both. Though where the Place or Territory of which any Perſon was <hi>Cohen,</hi> is mentioned, there it always ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies him to have been Prince or Civil Governour of that place. So <hi>S.

And ſo <hi>Artapanus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> IX. <hi>c.</hi> 27. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating <hi>Moſes</hi> his Flight into <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſaith he came to <hi>Raguel,</hi>

I ſhall only add, that it is moſt likely that this <hi>Prince</hi> (or <hi>Priest</hi>) was a Worſhipper of the true God, and not an Idolater: for <hi>Moſes,</hi> we may be confident, would not have married his Daughter, if ſhe had been bred in a falſe Religion.</p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the Shepherds came and drove them away.</hi>] Some rude and idle Shepherds would have made uſe of the Water, which they had drawn; and had the benefit of their pains, without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of their own. This looks like an Argument that their Father was not a <hi>Prince,</hi> for then, one would think, theſe Shepherds ſhould not have dared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with them. But it is as much an Argument that he was not a <hi>Priest;</hi> for they were great Men alſo in thoſe days. And it ſeems probable to me, that theſe were the Shepherds of ſome other greater Prince, in thoſe Countries; who made thus bold with <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Daughters and their Servants. For one cannot think, as I ſaid, that they alone looked after his Flock, but were Overſeers of thoſe that did, like <hi>Rebekkah</hi> and <hi>Rachel.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> XXIX. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Moſes <hi>ſtood up and helped them,</hi> &amp;c.] This was an act (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſuggeſts) of the ſame Heroick Spirit, mentioned before, Ver. 12. which ſtill reſted on him, and moved him here, as it had done in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And thus <hi>Philo</hi> alſo repreſents him as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>And he gave</hi> Moſes Zipporah <hi>his Daughter.</hi>] The Divine Writers do not relate all the paſſages of a Story (as other Authors delight to do) but only the moſt material. Therefore we are to ſuppoſe a great many things to have preceded this: which was not accompliſhed preſently after he was entertained into <hi>Reuel</hi>'s Houſe, but after he had had much Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of <hi>Moſes</hi> his other Vertues, as well as of his Valour.

                  <q>And therefore, he thinks, that <hi>Reuel</hi> being ſtruck firſt with admiration of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſpect, and then of his wiſe Diſcourſe, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60246:22"/>gave him the moſt beautiful of all his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be his Wife: not ſtaying to enquire of any body what he was, for his own moſt excellent Qualities ſufficiently recommended him to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Vita Moſes, p.</hi> 611.</q>

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And ſhe bare him a Son, and he called his Name</hi> Gerſhom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This word <hi>Gerſhom</hi> ſignifies a <hi>deſolate Stranger;</hi> which he made the Name of this Child, becauſe he was born, not only in a Foreign Country, remote from his own People; but in a place where he had nothing but what he earned by his Labour. For it is not to be thought, that in an haſty Flight he could bring any great matter with him into <hi>Midian.</hi> Either this Son was born long after his Marriage, or he did not marry till he had been long in this Country: For when he left it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 40 years ſtay in it, his Children were but young, as appears from IV. 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And it came to paſs, in proceſs of time.</hi>] After many days (as it is in the Hebrew) <hi>i. e.</hi> years: for this King reigned a long time. See <hi>Ver.</hi> 15.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>By reaſon of the Bondage.</hi>] This may be referred both to their <hi>Cry,</hi> and its <hi>coming up to God:</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſpeedily to free them from ſuch unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Burdens.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And God heard their groaning, and God remembred his Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.] There are <hi>four</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent words in theſe <hi>two laſt Verſes</hi> (viz. <hi>heard; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; looked upon them; had reſpect unto them</hi>) which, every one of them, ſignifie God's kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards them; but ſeem alſo to me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that the Divine Providence determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed gradually in the Deliverance of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their cruel Servitude. For when he ſaith, <hi>God heard their groaning;</hi> the meaning is, he favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably condeſcended to grant their Petition; which was the <hi>first</hi> ſtep to their Deliverance. And then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He remembred his Covenant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This gives the Reaſon of it, becauſe he was mindful of his ancient Promiſes to their Forefathers; which was a further aſſurance of his Favour. And then he</p>

                  <hi>His Father in Law.</hi>] This ſhows that the Seven Daughters ſpoken of II. 16. were the Children of <hi>Jethro</hi> and <hi>Reuel</hi> their Grandfather: unleſs we will ſay, as a great many do, that <hi>Jethro</hi> had two Names. Nay, they fancy he had three, being called <hi>Hobab</hi> they think, IV <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. where <hi>Hobab</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be the Father in Law of</hi> Moſes.

               <p>
                  <hi>And came to the Mountain of God, even to</hi> Horeb.] Sheep delight to feed on Mountains, as <hi>Bochart</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Whence ſuch mountainous Places are often called in <hi>Homer</hi>

See <hi>Hierozoic. p.</hi> 1. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 46. And this is called <hi>the Mountain of God,</hi> becauſe when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote this Book there had been a Divine appearance upon <hi>Horeb;</hi> which St. <hi>Stephen</hi> calls <hi>Sinai,</hi> VII <hi>Acts</hi> 30. For <hi>Horeb</hi> and <hi>Sinai</hi> ſeem to have been two tops of one and the ſame Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: which it is plain by this was not far from the Country of <hi>Midian.</hi> We underſtand alſo by St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s words, when this fell out, <hi>viz.</hi> after he had dwelt Forty years in <hi>Midian:</hi> for ſo long, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he continued there, VII <hi>Exod</hi> 7. But how he imployed all that time, we are not told. No doubt, in ſomething elſe than meer feeding Sheep. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned in all the Egyptian Wiſdom, we may well think he both taught others, and made alſo great improvements himſelf; in ſtudying the Records of that, and all other Neighbouring Countries: and beſides, received it is likely Divine Revelations. There are thoſe likewiſe, who think he now wrote the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> to comfort the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60246:24"/>example of his admirable Patience, under their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Oppreſſions in <hi>Egypt:</hi> and the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> alſo; that they might the better underſtand what Promiſes had been made to their Noble Anceſtors, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that the Time drew near when they would be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>It is noted by <hi>Ludovicus Capellus</hi> in his <hi>Chronolog. Sacra,</hi> that the Number <hi>Forty</hi> was much obſerved in the Adminiſtrations of Divine Providence: <hi>Moſes</hi> being XL years old when he fled into <hi>Midian,</hi> and ſtaying there another XL years, and then leaving the World in the end of the next XL years of his Age. It was ſo many years before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> got to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> after they were delivered out of <hi>Egypt. Forty</hi> days <hi>Moſes</hi> continued with God in the Mount; both the firſt and ſecond time of his going up thither. So many days the Spyes were in ſearching out the Land: and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had juſt ſo many Manſions in the Wilderneſs. Their firſt Judge governed juſt XL. years; and the next twice as many. <hi>Deborah, Barak, Gideon, Eli</hi> all judged XL years: and ſo long <hi>David</hi> reigned.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him.</hi>] So St. <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo, VII <hi>Acts</hi> 30. By which ſome underſtand the Eternal WORD, the Second Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity. But I think he is not called ſimply an <hi>Angel</hi> any where, but with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the <hi>Angel of the Covenant:</hi> for it would be a dangerous inſinuation, that he was but a meer Creature. Yet I believe he is not here to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for I take this to have been the Appearance of the SCHECHINAH; which comprehended both the LORD himſelf, and the Angels that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, as his Miniſters. One of which now
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60246:24"/>appeared ſo gloriouſly, that he ſhowed God to be preſent: and accordingly we find, in the following words, that he himſelf ſpake to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And thus the LORD is ſaid to have ſent his Angel, when they cried to him, and brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> XX <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. Which Angel is called <hi>Michael</hi> by <hi>Menachem;</hi> and the ſame which they alſo call <hi>Goel,</hi> who redeemed <hi>Jacob</hi> from all evil, XLVIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a flame of ſire.</hi>] The Glory of the LORD (as the SCHECHINAH is frequently called) appeared in a flaming manner like fire: exceeding bright, and with an amazed ſplendor. So it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, though not ſo bright, when the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made of their Deliverance, XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of the midst of a Buſh.</hi>] To ſhow, ſay the Jews, in <hi>Pirke Eliezer,</hi> Cap. XL. that God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, in their great Affliction and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: which was repreſented by this Buſh of Thorns or Briers (for ſo the Hebrew word ſignifies, ſuch a Buſh as pricks thoſe that touch it) or, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, LXIII. 9. <hi>in all their affliction he was afflicted.</hi> And by his Providence ordered things ſo, that their Affliction did not conſume them, but rather multiplied and increaſed them; for, as it there follows, <hi>the Angel of his preſence ſaved them.</hi> And thus <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us (in the latter end of <hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>Demonſtr. Evang. c.</hi> 13.) ſome Chriſtians underſtood it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Fire alſo in the Buſh might be intended to ſhow, that God would there meet with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and give them his Law in Fire and Lightning; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60246:25"/>yet not conſume them. For this is the place where God, after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> delivered the Law to them: which thence was called <hi>Sinai</hi> (ſaith the fore-named Author in <hi>Pirke Elieſer</hi>) from this Buſh; which in Hebrew is <hi>Sene,</hi> and ſignifies in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> a Thorn-buſh: whereas before this it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Horeb,</hi> from its drineſs and barrenneſs, as that word imports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And behold the Buſh burnt with ſire, and the Buſh was not conſumed.</hi>] The Heathens had either read, or heard of this wonder, as appears by <hi>Artapanus</hi> who mentions it (in <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> IX. <hi>Praepar. Evang. c.</hi> 27.) but he diſguiſes it and miſreports it; ſaying it was a Fire which ſuddenly broke forth out of the Earth, and flamed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when there was no Matter, nor any kind of Wood in the place to feed it. But in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but one an ancient <hi>Tragaedian</hi> reports it exactly, ſaying juſt as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth here, That <hi>the Buſh burnt in a great fire, and yet remained intire and green in the ſlame,</hi> which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. The meaning of which I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, in the foregoing Obſervation. There is a Story ſomething like this in <hi>Dion Pruſaeus, Orat.</hi> XXXVI. where he ſaith the <hi>Perſians</hi> relate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> that the Love of Wiſdom and Vertue leading him to a Solitary Life, ſeparate from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon a Mountain, he found it one day all in a flame, ſhining with Celeſtial Fire: out of the midſt of which he came without any harm, and inſtituted certain Sacrifices to God, who then he made account appeared to him. Which <hi>Joh. Henricus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> a good while ago endeavoured to prove, was nothing elſe but a corruption of this Apparition to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60246:25"/>And <hi>Huetius</hi> lately (in his <hi>Demonſtr. Evang. Propoſ.</hi> IV. Cap.

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſee this great ſight.</hi>] This wonderful Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; or, as <hi>Philo</hi> tranſlates it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Why the buſh is not burnt.</hi>] A Fire which did not burn (that is, conſume what it laid hold on) was very amazing. Yet the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did not think ſuch things incredible, as appears out of <hi>Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Thyeſte,</hi> where he ſpeaks of a Foreſt which appeared all on a flame, without fire: and out of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and divers other Authors, among the Pagans, produced by the Learned <hi>Huetius</hi> in his <hi>Queſtiones Alnetanae, L.</hi> II. <hi>Cap.</hi> XII. <hi>n.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And when the LORD ſaw that he turned aſide,</hi> &amp;c.] It is plain by this, that the LORD himſelf was here preſent: his <hi>Angels</hi> being but At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, as I ſaid, upon his Majeſty. See XXII <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God called unto him out of the midſt of the Buſh.</hi>] He now calls him <hi>God,</hi> whom juſt before he called LORD. Both which are ſometimes put together, as comprehending all the Divine Attributes. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> who makes <hi>Eleven</hi> Degrees of Prophecy (or Divine Communications to Men) juſtly thinks this the very higheſt of all, and it was peculiar to

                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> to hear God himſelf ſpeaking to him in a Viſion, when he was intirely awake.</p>

                  <hi>And ſaid,</hi> Moſes, Moſes.] He repeats his Name, to excite his attention. And ſome take it for a token of Familiarity. See XLVI <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. This is called by <hi>Gregor. Nyſſen</hi> (<hi>de Vita Moſis, p.</hi> 172.) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And he ſaid, draw not nigh hither.</hi>] He commands him to keep his diſtance, and not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to him. This, and what follows, plainly demonſtrate what I ſaid before, that this was an Appearance of the SCHECHINAH, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty; to whom he could not pay too great a Reverence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put off thy ſhoes from off thy feet.</hi>] Many frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reaſons have been given of this Precept, as may be ſeen in <hi>Braunius, L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>de Veſtitu Sacerd. Hebr.</hi> But the plain Reaſon is immediately added in the Text, becauſe the place where he ſtood was <hi>holy:</hi> into which it was irreverend to enter with their Shoes on; becauſe thereby it might be defiled with the dirt that adhered to them. Certain it is, that in the Temple afterwards, the Prieſts officiated barefoot; and all the Eaſtern People came into their Holy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſame manner: which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> thinks they learnt from this Example of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Opinion ſeems truer, That <hi>Moſes</hi> did not give the firſt beginning to this Rite; but it was derived from the Patriarchs before him, and tranſmitted to future Times from that ancient general Tradition.

               <p>What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> this was (it being a common Name to all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings) is very much diſputed.

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And they ſhall ſay unto me, What is his Name?

But <hi>Moſes</hi> being the firſt that ever ſpake to Men in the Name of God, (none of the Patriarchs, either before the Flood or after it, having ſaid any ſuch words as theſe, <hi>God hath ſent me to you: the Lord commands me to bid you do ſo or ſo,</hi> as <hi>Maimon.</hi> obſerves in ſeveral places of his <hi>More Nevoch.

He had ſpoken unto <hi>Noah</hi> and unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. but it was only for their own Inſtruction; He never bid them deliver any Meſſage unto others: and yet it is obſervable, that upon particular occaſions, he ſtill made himſelf known to them by different Names or Titles. As he ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. <hi>I am Jehovah, who brought thee out of</hi> Ur <hi>of the Chaldees.</hi> But XVII. 1. he ſaith, <hi>I am Elſhaddai.</hi> And to <hi>Iſaac</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I am the God of thy Father Abraham,</hi> XXVI. 24. To <hi>Jacob</hi> he adds, <hi>I am the LORD God of thy Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, XXVIII. 13. And after this, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Bethel, XXXI. 13. No wonder then that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould think the People
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60246:29"/>would expect, upon ſo great an occaſion, when he came to them as an Ambaſſadour from Heaven, that the God of their Fathers ſhould ſpeak to them in a New Stile, beyond all that had been known in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60246:31"/>hand of the Egyptians.</hi> Which was not yet actually done, but ſo abſolutely decreed in the Mind of God, that he might ſay he had already done it.

               <p>
                  <hi>And that which is done to you in</hi> Egypt.] For the word <hi>Seen</hi> is not in the Original. But either way, it relates to what God ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Ver. 7, 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us.</hi>] We have received a ſpecial Command from the Eternal God, whom we, and our Fore-fathers, worſhip: who hath appeared to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now let us go (we beſeech thee) three days journey into the Wilderneſs.</hi> They intended to go quite away; but at firſt are directed to demand only to go as far as Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> which was but <hi>three</hi> days Journey from <hi>Egypt,</hi> if they went the neareſt way to it. For this they were humble Petitioners; which is implyed in thoſe words, <hi>We beſeech thee.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And I will ſtretch out my hand.</hi>] As the <hi>hand</hi> of God ſignifies his Power, ſo the <hi>ſtretching it out,</hi> ſeems to ſignifie the exciting of that Power in mighty Deeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smite</hi> Egypt <hi>with all my wonders.</hi>] The Hebrew word for wonders, comes from a Root, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſomething <hi>ſingular,</hi> and not <hi>common.</hi> Such were all the Plagues God ſent upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> which made them the more wonderful.</p>

               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And I will give this People favour in the ſight of the Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.]. Diſpoſe their hearts to be kind to them, ſo that they ſhould readily furniſh them, with any thing they deſired.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>But every Woman ſhall borrow.</hi>] The word <hi>Shaal</hi> is of a doubtful meaning: for it ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in general, to <hi>ask</hi> or to <hi>pray,</hi> one may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, either to <hi>give</hi> or to <hi>lend.</hi> And if the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> askt their Neighbours to beſtow ſuch things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as are here mentioned; and they out of a deſire to be rid of them, or hoping ſpeedily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Goods, granted their Requeſts; no

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto him, What is that in thy hand?</hi>] He asks this queſtion to make way for what follows; and to move his attention to it.</p>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>put forth thy hand and take it by the tail,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows <hi>Moſes</hi> his Faith to have been great, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame his Fear.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And the LORD ſaid furthermore unto him; Put now thy hand into thy boſom,</hi> &amp;c.] He did not ask for a new ſign; but the LORD was graciouſly pleaſed to grant him a further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Faith; or rather, of the Faith of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi>

                  <hi>And he put his hand into his boſom, and when he took it out, behold it was leprous as Snow.</hi>] It was a wonderful thing that out of the ſame place ſhould come both the Diſeaſe and the Cure (as we read in the next Verſe, that by putting his hand into his boſom again, it became ſound) and it was the greater wonder, becauſe the Leproſie was a Diſeaſe, that was very hard to be cured. <hi>R. Elieſer,</hi> in the place fore-named, doth not give ſo good a reaſon for this ſign, as for the former: though it is not a bad one. For, he making a Queſtion, Why God ſhould give them a ſign by an unclean thing, and not by a clean, makes this Anſwer to it; Becauſe as a Leper is unclean, and makes others ſo, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the impure <hi>Egyptians</hi> had defiled the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but God ſhowed by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s drawing his hand out of his boſom again pure and clean, that he would deliver and purge the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> I ſhould think rather, that the Leproſie repreſented God's ſmiting the <hi>Egytians</hi> with his Plagues; and the Cure of it, God's remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of thoſe Plagues at <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prayer. But there is no end of ſuch Conceits. Therefore I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather obſerve, that God commanding him to work <hi>all theſe wonders before</hi> Pharaoh, (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) it is very probable, this gave occaſion to the fabulous Story which was invented in future Ages; that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>Leper,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> infected with that, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcabby Diſeaſes. For ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>contra Apion.</hi>) the Tale was told in <hi>Manetho</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and thence deſcended unto others, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was driven out of the Country, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first ſign.</hi>] Here he gives the reaſon, why he was pleaſed to add another ſign to the former; that he might overcome the incredulity, which he foreſaw would be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them.</p>
               <p>

And he ſaith they would <hi>believe;</hi> becauſe it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to ſuppoſe they would: though he likewiſe ſuppoſes in the next Verſe, ſome might ſtill remain incredulous; and therefore he adds another.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60246:35"/>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt take of the Water of the River, and pour it upon the dry Land; and the Water ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Blood.</hi>] This ſign was not wrought now, when God talked with him, as the two former were: for he was in the Deſert, far from the River here ſpoken of, and near no River at all. Therefore, in caſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not believe upon the ſight of the two former ſigns, this is ordered to be wrought, when he came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for their Conviction; by taking the Water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and turning it into Blood. Which might be well looked upon as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication that God was able to ſpoil that Water, which was the great Inſtrument of the fertility of that Country, and make their Land barren. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo put them in mind that the cry of the innocent Blood of their Infants, which had been drown'd in that River, was come up to God.</p>
               <p>There was a neceſſity that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with all theſe Powers, becauſe with an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Commiſſion: which would not have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, if he had not brought ſuch extraordinary proof of it.

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto the LORD, O my Lord.</hi>] This is a Form of Speech, whereby he declines this great Imployment; and deſires to be

               <p>
                  <hi>I am not Eloquent.</hi>] In the Hebrew, <hi>Am not a man of words;</hi> i. e. not a good Speaker; or, not accuſtomed to make Speeches; or, as ſome take it, a Man of few words: and therefore unfit to be ſent to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and much more to the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> to whom none but great Orators make Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes. <hi>Clemens</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> makes this an Argument of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Humility, and ſaith, he added theſe words (from I know not what Authour) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>But I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue.</hi>] Cannot bring forth my words readily; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them well. The <hi>Jews</hi> think he had ſome impediment in his Speech; ſo that he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſome Letters or Words exactly: at leaſt, not without ſuch difficulty, that it was long before he could bring them forth. But the LXX. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words <hi>ſlow of ſpeech,</hi> as if he had but a weak, ſmall, or ſlender voice; ſpeaking <hi>voce gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cili &amp; exili</hi> (as it may be tranſlated in Latin) which made him very unfit, he thought, to be an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. And this doth not diſagree with what St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> ſaith, that he <hi>was mighty in Words,</hi> as well as Deeds, VII <hi>Acts</hi> 22. for the ſenſe of what he ſpake was great and weighty; though his pronunciation was not anſwerable to it. Nor did his ill or weak pronunciation, nor his ſlowneſs in bringing forth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60246:36"/>his words, hinder him from being an excellent Judge, and deciding Cauſes from Morning to Night; as we read XVIII <hi>Exod.</hi> In the determination of which there was no need of Oratory; but of a quick Apprehenſion, exact Judgment, and proper Language; which he never wanted. One would think alſo, that by Uſe and Exerciſe he grew prompt in the delivery of his Mind; for he made ſeveral very long Speeches to the People: and eſpecially an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Diſcourſe before his departure out of the World, in the beginning of the Book of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> In the latter end of which, his <hi>Song</hi> ſhows that he wanted no eloquent words, when he pleaſed to uſe them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto him, who hath made mans mouth,</hi> &amp;c.] Cannot I who formed all the Organs of Speech, and made the reſt of mens Senſes, and when I pleaſe deprive them of their uſe, take away this Impediment of which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt, and make thee to ſpeak as roundly and gracefully, as any Man living? The Authour of <hi>the Life of</hi> Moſes (who makes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Moſes</hi> for killing the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> &amp;c. See II. 15.) fancies, that God puts him in mind of his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at that time: As if he had ſaid, Who taught thee to make thy Defence, when thou waſt Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Who made the King dumb that he could not urge and preſs thy Execution? Who made the Executioner deaf that he could not hear the Sentence when pronounced? And who made them all blind, that they could not ſee, when thou madeſt thy eſcape? which is very ingeniouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; but we have no aſſurance of the truth of this Explication.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60246:36"/>

This doth not ſignifie, as I take it, that if he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further diſputing gone about his Buſineſs, God would have given him a better Elocution: but that he would have made his words as powerful, as if they had been pronounced, with the greateſt advantage.

                  <hi>Send I pray thee by the hand of him, whom thou wilt ſend.</hi>] The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> having tranſlated the word SCHILO, XLIX <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. <hi>qui mittendus est,</hi> him that is to be ſent, it hath inclined ſeveral great Men to think, that <hi>Moſes</hi> here deſires God to ſend the MESSIAH. And ſeveral of the ancient Fathers (<hi>Juſt. Mart. Tertull.</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c.) were of this mind: as many later Interpreters, both of the <hi>Roman</hi> and of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Church, have been. Particularly <hi>Flacius Illyricus</hi> (in his <hi>Clavis</hi> upon the word MITTO) thus explains this Paſſage,
<q>
                     <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da id functionis,</hi> &amp;c. commit this Office to the true <hi>Meſſiah, or bleſſed Seed; whom thou hast reſolved to ſend:</hi> who will diſcharge this Truſt far better than I can do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But there have been and are other very conſiderable Perſons, who think <hi>Moſes</hi> means no more than this; <hi>Send a more proper Perſon; one ſitter for this Imployment than I am.</hi> And the truth is,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60246:37"/>ſuch Speeches as theſe in Scripture, do not denote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certain Perſon or Thing; but ſignifie ſomething indeſinite, and in general. Examples of which we have in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIII. 13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XV. 20. upon which Phraſe <hi>[Vado quo vado] I go whither I may,</hi> the ſame <hi>Flacius</hi> obſerves, that it denotes an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain motion. In like manner <hi>Moſes</hi> here determines his deſire to no particular Perſon: but only wiſhes God would ſend any Body rather than himſelf. And that he did not think of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> there is this Argument; that he had no reaſon to believe he was now born: and yet God's Promiſe was to ſend one immediately to relieve the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Upon which Errand alſo, if he had prayed God to ſend him, it would argue <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been in the ſame Errour with the preſent Jews, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be a Temporal Deliverer.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the Anger of the LORD was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against</hi> Moſes.] Theſe words ſeem to import, that God was highly diſpleaſed with him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that he had very much offended him. Yet ſome of the Fathers, particularly St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> impute his backwardneſs to ſerve in this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, unto his great Modeſty, Humility, and a deep Senſe of his own Infirmities: of which the wiſeſt and beſt Men are far more ſenſible than other Perſons. And then this Anger amounts to no more, than ſuch a Diſpleaſure as a Father hath at his Child, when he is too diſſident, notwithſtanding all that he hath ſaid and done to breed in him a juſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And therefore no Puniſhment followed this Anger (unleſs we think as <hi>R. Solomon</hi> doth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this backwardneſs God preferred <hi>Aaron's</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily above his, or that this was the Cauſe he would
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60246:37"/>not Cure his Imperfection of Speech) but only a Chiding: which we may ſuppoſe went before the following Queſtion, <hi>Is not</hi> Aaron <hi>the Levite thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> which carries ſomething of ſharpneſs in it.

And ſo both the LXX and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> interpret it, <hi>The Angel of the LORD:</hi> becauſe the LORD ſent an Angel to Execute what is here related.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſought to kill him.</hi>] Appeared in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if he intended to fall upon him (with a drawn Sword perhaps, as he did to <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) which threatning Poſture could not but very much affright him, and put him into diſorder. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers imagine he inflicted a ſudden Diſeaſe upon him; or made as if he would ſtrangle him. They that interpret this of killing his <hi>Child,</hi> as many do (See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. Cap.</hi> VI. <hi>p.</hi> 88.) ſeem to me to have no reaſon on their ſide: there being no mention of a Child in the foregoing Story; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his Sons. Therefore <hi>Chaskuni</hi> hath rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that this Verſe is connected with the laſt words of the 20th, (the <hi>three</hi> following coming by a <hi>Parentheſis</hi>) and can refer to none but <hi>Moſes.</hi> All the difficulty is to find, why the Angel of the Lord
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60246:41"/>ſhould put him in fear of preſent death; when he was going upon God's Meſſage. The Reſolution of which ſeems to be contained in the following words.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Then Zipporah.</hi>] His Wife preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended what was the Cauſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his danger, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe her Child (of which ſhe is ſuppoſed to have been not long ago delivered) was not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. And therefore ſhe immediately diſpatcht that work: her Husband being in ſuch a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he could not do it himſelf; but (as <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> will have it) called to her to do it; or ſhe of her ſelf went about it, having been the Cauſe that it was not done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Took a ſharp Stone.</hi>] Or a ſharp Knife made of a Flint: for ſuch they uſed; which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi>) calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And cut the foreskin of her Son.</hi>] But how come <hi>Moſes</hi> to neglect this Duty? Moſt ſay his Wife was unwilling to it: not becauſe ſhe abhorred this Rite, as cruel and unnatural (for ſhe was of a Race, which came from <hi>Abraham,</hi> who firſt received this Command of Circumciſing all his Children; and ſhe underſtood, it appears, how to do it readily, without indangering the Child, which had ſcarce been poſſible, if ſhe had been a Stranger to it) but becauſe the <hi>Midianites</hi> perhaps did not Circumciſe ſo ſoon as the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> but imitated their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> who deferred it till their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were <hi>Thirteen</hi> years old, at which Age <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was Circumciſed (XVII <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.) or rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were about to take a Journey, when ſhe thought it might be omitted; till they came to be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60246:42"/>ſetled among the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And truly, this ſeems to have been a good reaſon, to defer Circumciſion beyond the <hi>Eighth</hi> day: motion being dangerous, when the Child was ſore. But ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have truſted God to take care of his Child; and not have been afraid of the Conſequence, if he had performed his Duty. And becauſe he followed the tender Inclination of his Wife, rather than a plain Precept (XVII <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, 13, &amp;c.) he fell into this great danger. Many other accounts are given of this, (for the truth is, the whole matter is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure) but I ſee none more probable, than what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And cast it at his feet.</hi>] It is uncertain at whoſe ſeet ſhe caſt it: whether at he <hi>Husband</hi>'s, or the <hi>Child</hi>'s, or the <hi>Angel</hi>'s. The firſt ſeems moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; if the next words be ſpoken to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they ſeem to me to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid, ſurely a bloody Husband art thou to me.</hi>] If the foregoing Interpretation be true, theſe are not the words of an angry Woman; but ſpoken with great affection: ſignifying that ſhe had eſpouſed him again; having ſaved his Life by the Blood of her Son. Our famous Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> indeed, (<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XIV.) carries the Senſe quite another way: becauſe an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he ſaith, is never called <hi>Chatan</hi> after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Solemnity was over. Which, if it be true, makes nothing againſt what I have ſaid; becauſe ſhe lookt upon her ſelf as a ſecond time <hi>eſpouſed</hi> (or married) to him by this act: which had reſtored him to her, when his Life was in danger. It muſt be granted that the word <hi>Chatan</hi> doth not ſignifie only a <hi>Spouſe;</hi> but ſometime a <hi>Son in Law:</hi> but why <hi>Zipporah</hi> ſhould call her <hi>own Child</hi> by this Name, I do not ſee. Yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60246:42"/>ſo Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> underſtands it; and adds that the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> tell us, it was the cuſtom of the Hebrew Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to call their Children, when they were Circumciſed, by the Name of <hi>Chatan,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Spouſe</hi>) as if they were now eſpouſed unto God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> ſaith ſo: but I cannot find that this was an ancient Notion among them. If it were, his Interpretation might be the more eaſily embraced, which is this: That theſe were a ſolemn form of words uſed at Circumciſion; ſignifying as much, as <hi>I pronounce thee to be a Member of the Church by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> Thus <hi>Val. Schindler</hi> alſo expounds it (in his <hi>Lexic. Pentaglot. p.</hi> 677.) a Child was called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> upon the Day of his Circumciſion, <hi>becauſe then he was firſt joyned to the People of God, and as it were eſpouſed unto God.</hi> And he thinks the <hi>Targum</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances this Senſe, when it thus expounds theſe words, <hi>by this Blood of Circumciſion a Spouſe is given to us.</hi> Which may as well be underſtood of <hi>Moſes</hi> being given to her, as of the Child: for he was, as I ſaid, reſtored to her and to his Family, upon the Circumciſion of the Child. So it follows in the next Verſe. They that have a mind to ſee the Senſe of an eminent Writer of our Church, concerning this Paſſage, may conſult <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> Book V. in the latter end of the LXII Section, where he thus far agrees with me, that theſe words were ſpoken <hi>out of the flowing of abundance of Commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Love,</hi> with her hands laid under his feet. For ſo he thinks theſe words, <hi>She cast it at his feet,</hi> import.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>So he let him go.] i. e.</hi> The Angel no longer threatned <hi>Moſes</hi> with death: but his Wife, to her great joy, ſaw him reſtored to her in ſafety. From

Or (according to our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as ſoon as her Husband was ſafe, ſhe repeated the foregoing words, ſaying, <hi>I have redeemed thy life, by circumciſing thy Son.</hi> They that make theſe words to have been ſpoken in a rage, becauſe ſhe was forced to do what ſhe did, ſuppoſe her to have had little kindneſs for her Husband; and as little regard to Circumciſion. I ſhould rather Tranſlate the words, <hi>So ſhe let him go;</hi> i. e. let <hi>Moſes</hi> go to <hi>Egypt;</hi> and went back her ſelf to her Father: only repeating theſe words before ſhe went, <hi>Remember me, how I have ſaved thy Life, and made thee my Husband again (when Death was at hand) by the Blood of thy Son, whom I have Circumciſed.</hi> There is only this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, that the Hebrew word for <hi>let him go</hi> is of the Maſculine Gender: which is of no great weight, becauſe it is uſual in this Language, when they ſpeak of Females (as I obſerved on I. 21.) and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhe returned to her Father; but whether in this manner no Body can certainly determine. For we are not told any where, upon what occaſion ſhe went
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60246:43"/>back to <hi>Jethro</hi> (unleſs it be here inſinuated) as we find ſhe did (XVIII. 2.) together with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>commanded the ſame day, the Task-maſters of the People, and their Officers.</hi>] The <hi>Task-maſters</hi> were the chief Exactors of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, being <hi>Egyptians:</hi> who had <hi>Officers</hi> under them to execute their Orders, and to give an account how they were obeyed: And it appears from <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, &amp;c. that they were <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Ye ſhall no more give the People ſtraw to make brick, as heretofore,</hi> &amp;c.] Inſtead of eaſing them, he increaſed their Burdens, and made them intolerable. What the uſe of <hi>Straw</hi> was in making Bricks, is variouſly conjectured. Some think it was mixed with the Clay, to make the Bricks more ſolid. Others, that they only heated their Kilns with it, to burn the Bricks. Others, (who think they were not baked in a Kiln) imagine it ſerved only to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; that they might not be crackt by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of the Sun, wherein they were baked. For
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60246:46"/>ſo <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tells us, that the beſt Bricks were made in the <hi>Spring</hi> and in the <hi>Autumn, ut uno tenore ſicceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> that they might dry by an equal heat: they that were made at the <hi>Solſtice</hi> being ſuddenly cruſted over by the Sun, and left too moiſt within, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect. c.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the tale of the Bricks, which they did make heretofore, you ſhall lay upon them,</hi> &amp;c.] It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. that there was a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity exacted from them every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For they be idle, and therefore they cry, ſaying, Let us go and Sacrifice to our God.</hi>] They have not work enough, to employ their Thoughts; which makes their Mind wander after other things.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Let there more work be laid upon the Men.</hi>] Or, make it <hi>heavy upon them</hi> (as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they may labour therein.</hi>] Have no time to think of any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And let them not regard vain words.</hi>] So he calls the Meſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> who, he pretends, were meer Deceivers, and fed their Hope with Lyes, (for ſo it is in the Hebrew, <hi>words of falſhood,</hi> or <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words</hi>) or, at leaſt, he reſolved their words ſhould not prove true; for he would not let the People go.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>I will not give you Straw.</hi>] The Task-maſters with their Officers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the King's Order, that every Body might take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Go, get you Straw where you can find it,</hi> &amp;c.] A heavy Sentence; importing that whether they could find any or no, no abatement would be made of the number of Bricks that was expected from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60246:47"/>them. This was to drive them to Deſperation, by demanding things impoſſible. And added (as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radus Pellicanus</hi> obſerves) to the Burdens on their Bodies, very ſore Anguiſh of Mind. For it tempted them to doubt of the Goodneſs of their God, who they thought had ſent a deliverer to them (IV. 31.) by whom they were now reduced into a more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>So the People were ſcattered abroad, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Some part of them were forced to go, and pick up Straw, or for want of it, Stuble (and ſometime travel a great way for it) while the reſt were working in the Brick-kilns, without their help, which they were wont to have: whereby they were diſabled from making ſo many Bricks, as formerly they had done.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the Task-maſter haſted them,</hi> &amp;c.] Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in their work; when they ſaw they were likely to fall ſhort of their wonted Task.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the Officers of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c.] By this it appears (as I ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 6.) that theſe <hi>Officers</hi> were <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And from this place <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Bertram</hi> concludes (<hi>Lib. de Rep. Hebr. Cap.</hi> IV.) that there was a Civil Government among the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> all the time they were in <hi>Egypt:</hi> and that theſe <hi>Schoterim</hi> (as they are called in Hebrew) were Men of the greateſt Note among the Elders; who execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their Decrees; and conſequently of high Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the People. For which reaſon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Task-maſters choſe them, to Overſee and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Labours of their Brethren. But Mr. <hi>Selden L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. Cap.</hi> XV. hath made it appear, that there was no ſuch Judicature among them at this time; and when there was, this was the Name of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60246:47"/>thoſe who executed the Sentence of the Judges: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to our <hi>Apparitors,</hi> and ſuch like under Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. See <hi>p.</hi> 621, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were beaten.</hi>] With Sticks; or ſcourged with Rods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore have yet not fulfilled your Task, both ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday,</hi> &amp;c.] They puniſhed the Officers, as if they had been negligent in not preſſing the People to their Duty. Yet it ſeems they forbore them one day, to ſee if they would mend their Fault the next.</p>
               <p>V. 15. <hi>Then the Officers of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>came and cried unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>ſaying,</hi> &amp;c.] They had ſome hope this Oppreſſion might proceed from the <hi>Task-maſters,</hi> and not from the King himſelf: and therefore they repreſented their Caſe to him, and petitioned for Relief. It is ſaid indeed <hi>v.</hi> 6. that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> laid this Command, both upon the <hi>Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters</hi> and their <hi>Officers:</hi> but it is not unlikely that he gave it immediately only to the Task-maſters, who were his own Miniſters, and by them to the Officers.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thy Servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own People.</hi>] This ſhows that they thought ſuch Inhumane Uſage was the effect of the Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>But he ſaid, ye are idle, ye are idle,</hi> &amp;c.] He ſoon made them underſtand it was by his Decree, and not his Servants pleaſure, that they were thus uſed. And, which was worſe, they ſaw he was ſixed in his Reſolution; being void of all pity; and mocking at their Complaints. For nothing could be more Sarcaſtical, than to tell them they were idle, when they ſunk under their Burdens.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60246:48"/>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Go, therefore now and work,</hi> &amp;c.] Do not ſpend your time in making Complaints to me; but return immediately to your Labours, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue at them, till my Commands be executed: and expect no mitigation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And the Officers did ſee that they were in evil Caſe,</hi> &amp;c.] By this Anſwer they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reduced to ſuch Straits, that now they deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Relief: the King himſelf being ſet againſt them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And they met</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>who ſtood in the way, as they came forth from</hi> Pharaoh.] They had placed themſelves there on purpoſe, to hear what Succeſs the Officers had in their Petition.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And they ſaid, the LORD look upon you and judge.</hi>] This ſeems to be an Imprecation: or, at leaſt, the Officers bid <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> expect, that God would take them to task (as we ſpeak) for bringing his People into ſo bad a Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye have made our Savour to be abhorred in the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] Made us odious; as this Phraſe ſignifies, XXXIV <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To put a Sword into their hand to ſlay us.</hi>] Who may take an occaſion from hence, and make this a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for the deſtroying our whole Nation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>returned unto the LORD.</hi>] this plainly intimates, that the LORD had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſince he came to <hi>Egypt;</hi> as he did at Mount <hi>Horeb:</hi> and that he appeared in ſome ſetled place, where he might upon all Occaſions reſort to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid, LORD, wherefore hast thou ſo evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated this People?</hi> &amp;c.] It was to no purpoſe to anſwer the Officers who expoſtulated with him; for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60246:48"/>they were too much exaſperated, and thereby preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt any thing he could ſay. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he choſe rather to repreſent to God the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints they had made to him: that he might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what Satisfaction to give them. For he was not able of himſelf, to give an account, why the LORD ſhould ſuffer their Condition to grow worſe, rather than better, ſince he delivered his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> No, nor why he ſhould ſend him on an Embaſſy, which was not at all regarded.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>For ſince I came to</hi> Pharaoh <hi>to ſpeak in thy Name, he hath done Evil to this People; neither hast thou delivered thy People at all.</hi>] He might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that God told him more than once, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not obey him at the firſt, III. 19. IV. 21. But the bitter Reflections which the Officers of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made upon his Conduct, had ſo diſturbed his Mind, that he forgot himſelf ſo far, as to ask the undecent Queſtions mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, and complains here that God had done Nothing to fulfil his Promiſe of Deliverance to his People.</p>

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And God ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>and ſaid unto him, I am the LORD.</hi>] He alſo anſwers here to his firſt Queſtion <hi>[Why hast thou ſent me?]</hi> by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, I am <hi>JEHOVAH;</hi> and have ſent thee to make known this great Name, that is, my ſelf; who am conſtant to my word, and will faithfully perform all my Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And I appeared unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>unto</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>by the Name of God Almighty.</hi>] Or, <hi>God All-ſufficient,</hi> as the word <hi>El-ſhaddai</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted (See XVII <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.)

                  <hi>quadam ab eo efferendo abſtinerent,</hi> but becauſe out of a Religious Reverence they abſtained from it. And this reſpect to it all the ancient Interpreters obſerve, even St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf: though in ſeveral of the ancient
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60246:49"/>Fathers (as <hi>Irenaeus, Clem, Alexandrinus, Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi>) and in ſome of the ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>) it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>Jaho,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the Greek write it. Which Name (however it be pronounced) ſome of the Jews imagine, was concealed till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; who was the firſt, to whom it was revealed. But this is evidently falſe, as appears from the whole Book of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and particularly from XV. 7. where (before he calls himſelf <hi>El-ſhaddai</hi>) he ſaith to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, I am Jehovah which brought thee out of</hi> Ur <hi>of the Chaldees.</hi> In ſhort, the Opinion of <hi>Reuchlinus</hi> (in his <hi>Verb.

For as ſoon as <hi>Eve</hi> brought forth her Firſt-born, ſhe ſaith, <hi>I have got a Man from the LORD,</hi> IV <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. which Name deſcended in a perpetual Succeſſion from <hi>Seth</hi> to <hi>Abraham:</hi> who when he went by God's Direction out of his own Country into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>LORD appeared to him there,</hi> and there <hi>he built</hi> an Altar to the LORD, XII <hi>Gen.</hi> 7, 8. And it is to be noted, that he doth not ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place, <hi>My Name Jehovah was not known to them;</hi> but <hi>I was not known to them by this Name.</hi> That is, by that which it imports; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>giving being</hi> (as we may ſay) to his Promiſes by the actual performance of them: <hi>i. e.</hi> by bringing them into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and in order to it, delivering them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Both which he had promiſed in the fore-named Chapter (XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, 18.) and now intended to make good. And thus <hi>R. Solomon</hi> interprets this place, as <hi>P. Fagius</hi> notes; <hi>I have promiſed, but have not yet performed.</hi>

               <p>The like Expreſſion we find in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as <hi>Theodorick Hackſpan</hi> hath obſerved (<hi>Diſput. de Nominibus Divinis,</hi> N. 15.)

               </p>
               <p>Which cannot ſignifie that the Jews did not then know, that this was one of the Names of God: but that all who blaſphem'd him ſhould be confuted by ſenſible Proofs which he would give, of his own unchangeable Reſolution to fulfil his Promiſes, in bringing them out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> which fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that he was JEHOVAH.</p>
               <p>Which word, ſome think, includes in it, not only his Eternal Exiſtence, and Immutable Truth; but his Omnipotent Power, which gave being to all things. The laſt of which, was now made known, ſo as it had never been to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt that wrought Miracles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies: God was known to the Fathers, by Viſions and Dreams: but not by Signes and Wonders. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> made him known by theſe unto the World.

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And I will bring you unto the Land, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I did ſwear to give it,</hi> &amp;c.] Two things were promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that <hi>Viſion</hi> mentioned XV <hi>Gen. First,</hi> That he would deliver his Seed from this Nation which oppreſſed them (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That he would bring them into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> v. 16. Both theſe he now declares ſhould be fulfilled (the former in the foregoing Verſe, and the latter in this) and thereby they ſhould be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he was indeed <hi>Jehovah,</hi> true and conſtant to his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am the LORD.</hi>] He concludes as he began: having ſaid this twice before, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpake ſo unto the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>] He delivered this Meſſage, as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: which one would have expected, ſhould have raiſed their drooping Spirits. But quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They hearkened not unto</hi> Moſes.] They did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or receive what he ſaid, (So <hi>Maimon. More Nev. P.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 45.) or it made no Impreſſion upon them. The Reaſon follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For anguiſh of Spirit.</hi>] In the Hebrew, becauſe of <hi>ſhortneſs of Breath.</hi> They were ſo extreamly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they could ſcarce fetch their Breath, as we
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60246:52"/>ſpeak. Or, had no heart ſo much as to think of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, much leſs hope for it: but ſunk under their burdens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for cruel Bondage.</hi>] Common Slaves, though they cannot deliver themſelves, rejoyce to hear the good News that they are likely to be delivered by thoſe, who have power and will to do it. But in this Slavery, they were uſed ſo cruelly, that they were quite dejected, and uncapable of any Comfort. So the LXX. tranſlate the foregoing words <hi>(for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Spirit)</hi>

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>] It is likely that <hi>Moſes</hi> finding the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo regardleſs of what he ſaid, went to the uſual place, where he was wont to have recourſe to the Divine Majeſty, (See <hi>v.</hi> 22.) to receive new Directions what to do.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Go in, ſpeak unto</hi> Pharaoh <hi>King of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] The LORD bids him go again to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and renew the Demand he made before, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpake before the LORD.</hi>] This Phraſe <hi>liphne Jehovah,</hi> before the LORD, plainly denotes that God appeared unto him in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Majeſty, as I obſerved above <hi>v.</hi> 1. and See XI. 4.</p>

                  <hi>Behold, the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>have not hearkened to me, how then ſhall</hi> Pharaoh <hi>hear me?</hi>] Their faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs diſheartened <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, and made him unwilling to renew his Addreſs unto <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And there ſeems to be good reaſon in what he ſays; if the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe intereſt it was to give ear to him, did not believe him; what hope was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60246:52"/>there that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould comply againſt his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who am of uncircumciſed Lips.</hi>] This Reaſon he had alledged before, and was fully anſwered (IV. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and therefore ought not to have been repeated now. For his being <hi>of uncircumciſed Lips</hi> ſignifies no more than that he was an ill Speaker, and wanted Eloquence: It being the manner of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews to call thoſe parts <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi> which are inept to the uſe, for which they were deſigned, and cannot do their Office. Thus <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith of the Jews, that their <hi>ear was uncircumciſed;</hi> and adds the Explication, <hi>they cannot hearken,</hi> VI <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. In like manner <hi>uncircumciſed Lips,</hi> are Lips that cannot utter words; as <hi>uncircumciſed in heart,</hi> IX <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. are ſuch as cannot underſtand. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> puts both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>uncircumciſed in heart and ears,</hi> VII <hi>Acts</hi> 51. Perhaps <hi>Moſes</hi> thought it ſome diſparagement to him, that he was not able himſelf to deliver his Mind, in an handſome manner unto <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and therefore mentions this again, to move the Divine Majeſty, to <hi>circumciſe his Lips,</hi> (as they ſpeak) that is, remove this impediment.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron.] Here is no expreſs Anſwer made to his Objection, but it ſeems to be included in God's ſpeaking <hi>unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and unto</hi> Aaron; whereas before he had ſpoken only to <hi>Moſes,</hi> v. 1, 10. And it is likely <hi>Moſes</hi> was admoniſhed, that the LORD having given him <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſupply his defect, he ought to be ſatisfied therewith: and go with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Addreſs, both to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and alſo unto Pharaoh. So theſe words have reſpect to both parts of the foregoing Objection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And gave them a Charge unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] He laid his Commands upon them, ſtrictly requiring them to obey him. Which is an higher Expreſſion than we meet withal before in the foregoing Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (either in <hi>v.</hi> 6. or 11.) and makes me think this Verſe is not a meer Recapitulation of what had been ſaid, as ſome take it; but an Inforcement of what he had before commanded.</p>

                  <hi>And unto</hi> Pharaoh <hi>King of</hi> Egypt, <hi>to bring the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the Land of</hi> Egypt.] I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he now gave them Authority to Threaten him, if he did not obey.</p>

               <p>There have been Critical Wits, who made this an Argument, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of theſe Books: becauſe it is not likely, they imagine, he would write thus of himſelf. But no Body but theſe Criticks can ſee any Abſurdity in it, that he and his Brother, being the Inſtruments in Gods hand of effecting ſuch wonderful things, ſhould not let Poſterity be ignorant of it: but take care not only to Record it, but to ſet a ſpecial Note upon it, that none might rob them of the Honour God beſtowed on them; and He (by whoſe direction this was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) might have the glory of working ſuch mighty things, by ſuch inept Inſtruments, as <hi>Moſes</hi> often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges himſelf to have been. Nor is this more than <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſay concerning themſelves: and St. <hi>John</hi> may as well be denied to be the Authour of the Goſpel which bears his Name, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>This is the Diſciple that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth theſe things,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Some ſlight Wits have from this place alſo drawn an Argument, that this Book was not written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> but by ſome other Authour long after his time. Becauſe the word <hi>Nabi,</hi> they fancy, was not now in uſe to ſignifie a Prophet: as appears, ſay they, from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> IX. 9. where it is ſaid, <hi>He that is now called (Nabi) a Prophet, was before time called (Roch) a Seer.</hi> Which ſeems to ſignifie that the word <hi>Nabi</hi> (which <hi>Moſes</hi> here uſes for a <hi>Prophet</hi>) was but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into uſe, in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s days. But this is very far from <hi>Samuel</hi>'s meaning: whoſe plain ſenſe is this, that he who foretold things to come, or diſcovered
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60246:57"/>ſecrets, was anciently called a <hi>Seer,</hi> not a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Which ſignified heretofore only an Interpreter of the Divine Will: but now they began, in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s days, to apply the word <hi>Nabi</hi> (or <hi>Prophet</hi>) to thoſe who could reveal any Secret, or foreſee Things future. Which had not been the uſe of the word formerly: but it ſignified, as I ſaid, one that was familiar with God, and knew his Mind, and delivered it to others: as I obſerved upon XX <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. where God himſelf calls <hi>Abraham</hi> a Prophet; as he here calls <hi>Aaron.</hi> And what holy Writer would dare to alter the word which God himſelf uſed? Which is far more proper alſo to this purpoſe than either <hi>ROEH</hi> or <hi>CHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEH</hi> (which theſe Men ſancy were the words in uſe in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, not <hi>Nabi</hi>) for they do not anſwer the intention of God in this Speech concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aaron.</hi> Who was not to ſee, and Divine, or to receive Revelations from God; but to be a Mouth to <hi>Moſes;</hi> to utter what God revealed to him, not to <hi>Aaron.</hi> Which is the original ſignification of the word <hi>Nabi:</hi> there being no derivation of it ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that I can find, as that of <hi>R. Solomon</hi>'s, from the word <hi>Nub,</hi> which ſignifies to utter, or to bring forth, X <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Thou ſhall ſpeak all that I command thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This explains the latter end of the former Verſe: that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould deliver God's Mind to <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould deliver it to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him from God to diſmiſs the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of his Country.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And I will harden</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>heart.</hi>] Or, <hi>but</hi> I will harden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Avenarius</hi> tranſlates, <hi>I will permit his heart to be hardned.</hi> Though there is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60246:58"/>no need of it; for God here only foretels what <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> would force him to do, (See IV. 21.) after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Signs and Wonders had been wrought to move him to Obedience. For he was ſo ſtupid, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart ſo often, (VIII. 15, 32.) that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion God hardned him, by withdrawing all good motions from him. And therefore, the firſt time that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſaid to harden his heart, there is a ſpecial remembrance of this, that the LORD had foretold it, IX. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And multiply my Signs and my Wonders,</hi> &amp;c.] The firſt Plagues that were inflicted on him, proving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; it was neceſſary to ſend more and greater, that if it had been poſſible, his heart might have been mollified.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>But</hi> Pharaoh <hi>will not hearken unto you.</hi>] Or rather, <hi>and</hi> Pharaoh ſhall not hearken to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For this was the effect of his hardning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>By great Judgments.</hi>] That is, grievous Plagues; which he inflicted on them, one after another. And thereby made good his word, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be <hi>a God to</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>v.</hi> 1. that is, a Judge, as the word <hi>Elohim</hi> ſometimes ſignifies. See VI. 6.</p>

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>did as the LORD commaded them, ſo did they.</hi>] He repeats what he ſaith of their Obedience to God's Commands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from this time forward, they no longer diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor made any Objection; but roundly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>was fourſcore years old,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under an heavy Perſecution when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was born; and God exerciſed their Patience (it appears by this) a very long time, that their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance might be for ever remembred with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Thankfulneſs and Obedience. Such grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as theſe were fitteſt to be imployed as God's Commiſſioners in this Affair: for they could not well be thought to be hot-headed Men, who thruſt themſelves forward into this Embaſſy, without a Warrant. So ſome of the Jews very judiciouſly have obſerved, that God made choice of aged Men to work all his Miracles before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Revelations, becauſe they were not apt to invent, nor to be under the power of Fancy, at thoſe years. See <hi>Sepher Coſri, L.</hi> I. <hi>Sect.</hi> 83. where <hi>Buxtorf</hi> notes that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> obſerves upon this place, That <hi>none beſides</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ever propheſyed in their old Age;</hi> becauſe they were more excellent than all the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying.</hi>] When they were about to renew their Addreſs to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God was pleaſed again to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60246:59"/>appear and give them his Directions in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>When</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſhall ſpeak unto you, ſaying, ſhew a Miracle for you.</hi>] It was likely that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would, when he was not in a Paſſion, ask, How ſhall I know that you come from God with this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to me? give me ſome proof of your Authority: And ſuch a proof as can be done by none, but by the Power of God. And therefore God directs <hi>Moſes</hi> what to do in this caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>Take thy Rod.</hi>] The ſame Rod, is ſometime called the <hi>Rod of God,</hi> (IV. 20.) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod, and ſometime <hi>Aarons:</hi> as we find it in many places, <hi>v.</hi> 10. &amp; 19. of this Chapter; and VIII. 5.19, &amp;c. Becauſe God wrought all the following Miracles by this Rod; which ſometimes <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Aaron</hi> held in their hand. But commonly <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered it unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> as an Agent under him, to ſtretch it out for the effecting of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For he tells <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in this very Chapter, that with the Rod, which was in his hand, he would <hi>ſmite the Waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 17. And immediately the LORD bad him <hi>Say unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>Take thy Rod, and ſtretch out thy hand upon the Waters of</hi> Egypt, <hi>v.</hi> 19. By which it appears he had delivered the Rod unto <hi>Aaron.</hi> For a <hi>Rod</hi> being the Enſign of Authority, Prophets were wont to carry one in their hand, in token of their Office. And ſo did the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians alſo, who had every one their Rod ready to throw down, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And <hi>Mercury,</hi> whom the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians counted a Prophet (and thence called him <hi>Anubis</hi>) was repreſented with a Wand in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And cast it before</hi> Pharaoh.] As God had before directed <hi>Moſes,</hi> IV. 3, 21.</p>

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>went in unto</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, <hi>and did ſo as the LORD commanded them.</hi>] At their firſt Addreſs to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> they only delivered their Meſſage; but did nothing to confirm it, V. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor were they commanded now to work any Miracle, unleſs <hi>Pharaoh</hi> demanded one. Which it is likely he did; this ſecond Addreſs to him, moving him to ask, How ſhall I know that you come from God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>cast down his Rod before</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and before his Servants.</hi>] The great Men of the Court, who are always ſuppoſed to be preſent where the King was; though not mentioned in the foregoing Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it became a Serpent.</hi>] See IV. 3. where we read that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, when this Change was firſt made, <hi>fled from before it;</hi> the ſight of it was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. And therefore it is highly probable, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his Servants were no leſs ſtartled, at the firſt appearance of it. <hi>Artapanus</hi> relates ſeveral other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles beſides this, in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Praepan. Evang. p.</hi> 434, 435, &amp; 441. which I mention to ſhow that the Fame of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles was ſpread among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: who were ſo far from disbelieving them, that they gave credit to other falſe Reports, which ſome ill People had mingled with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Then</hi> Pharaoh <hi>alſo called the Wiſe men.</hi>] When he had recovered the fright in which we may well ſuppoſe him to have been, he ſent ſome of his Servants, to call in thoſe who he thought could cope with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in wonderful Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wiſe men.</hi>] This word is ſometimes uſed in a good ſenſe: and therefore to ſhow they were ſuch, as we now call <hi>Cunning-men,</hi> he joyns another
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60246:60"/>word to it, which is never taken in a good ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

For the Hebrew word <hi>Ciſcheph</hi> (from whence comes <hi>Macaſchephim,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Sorcerers</hi>) ſignifies to delude the ſight with falſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.

Some tranſlate it <hi>Necromancers:</hi> but it being a foreign word, we cannot determine its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meaning: though in general, no doubt, it ſignifies men, that by evil Arts, performed amazing things: Such as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Elymas</hi> in after times. See XLI <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. and <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con P.</hi> 2. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> XVIII.) where he hath a large Diſcourſe, about the meaning of this word <hi>Chartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim:</hi> which, after all that others have ſaid about it, he thinks comes from the word <hi>Retan:</hi> which in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> ſignifies to <hi>murmur,</hi> as Magicians were wont to do in their Incantations.

               <p>The Original of which ſort of Men ſeems to have been this; that God being pleaſed to admit the holy Patriarchs to familiar Colloquies with him, the Devil indeavoured to imitate him; that he might keep Men in his Obedience, by pretending Diſcoveries of Secret things to them. And when God was pleaſed to work Miracles for the confirmation of the Truth, the Devil directed theſe Men, who were familiar with him, how to invoke his help, for the performance of ſtrange things, which confirmed them in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They alſo did in like manner with their Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>] If the Hebrew word come from <hi>lahat</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>flame,</hi> (See III <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.) it ſeems to denote ſuch Sorcerers as dazzled Mens eyes, and then impoſed on them by ſhows and appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things, which had no real being.

               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, I will ſmite with the Rod, that is in mine hand.</hi>] God and <hi>Moſes</hi> are repreſented in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, as one Perſon (according to what he had ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 1. of this Chapter) and therefore it was the ſame thing to ſay, the LORD (whoſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> had begun to recite) <hi>will ſmite;</hi> or, to ſay, <hi>I will ſmite.</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 16.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Waters of the River, and they ſhall be turned into Blood.</hi>] This Plague was the more remarkable, becauſe, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> here obſerves, they having drowned the Hebrew Children in this River, God now puniſhes them for it, by giving them bloody Water to drink, XII <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7, 8. And if they had the ſame Notions then, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had in future times, the Plague was the more terrible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it fell on that, which they thought had ſome Divinity in it, and (as the ſame <hi>Theodoret</hi> obſerves) was honoured as a God; becauſe it made Plenty, when it overflow'd its Banks.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew Doctors add another reaſon for this Puniſhment; becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had hindred them from their wonted <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> (as the Authour of <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes ſpeaks) that is, ſaith <hi>Gaulmyn,</hi> from Purifying themſelves in the River by Bathing, after they had lain in of their Children: which in the ſcarcity of Water in that Country, could no where be done but in the River.</p>

(See there) immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The firſt of which was the death of the Fiſh; which periſhed in ſuch great numbers, that the River ſtank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there was Blood throughout all the Land of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.] The Waters were in all places turned into Blood, except perhaps the Land of <hi>Goſhen:</hi> which is not comprehended under the <hi>Land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And the Magicians of</hi> Egypt <hi>did ſo with their Inchantments.</hi>] See <hi>v.</hi> 11. In ſome of the Pools or Lakes of Water they made an appearance of the like Change: which made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> think his God was as powerful as the God of the Hebrews. The Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> as I ſaid, might poſſibly be free from this Plague; as it was certainly from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60246:66"/>of the reſt; (VIII. 23. IX. 4, &amp;c.) and ſome fancy the Magicians had Water from thence, to ſhow their power upon. But I cannot think it probable, that they made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſtay ſo long: and one may as well ſay they had it out of the Sea; or out of the Pits that the People digged, <hi>v.</hi> 24. as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and <hi>Juſtin. Martyr. Quaest. &amp; Reſp.</hi> XXVI. <hi>ad Orthodox.</hi> But there is no need of any of theſe Conjectures, if it be granted (as the Hiſtory leads us to conclude) that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not in a moment change all the Waters of the Country, but only thoſe of the River (as I ſaid on <hi>v.</hi> 20.) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by degrees all the reſt; when the Magicians had tried their Art upon ſome of them. Which <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo turned into real Blood; ſo that neither they, nor any body elſe, was able to drink of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s heart was hardned.</hi>] The very ſame words in the Hebrew, which we had before <hi>v.</hi> 13. where they ſhould have been tranſlated (I there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) as they are here; and alſo in VIII. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither did he hearken unto them, as the LORD had ſaid.</hi>] III. 19. This was more apt to move his heart than the former Miracle, becauſe it continued longer, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and the Magicians could not by all their Spells, or Skill in Sorcery, remove this Plague, in all that time. See next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>turned and went unto his</hi> Houſe.] It ſeems that upon his refuſal to hearken unto <hi>Moſes</hi> his Monition (<hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, &amp;c.) God ſent this Plague that very Morning, before he got home to Dinner. So that there was not time to fetch Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from diſtant places: but the Magicians exerciſed their Inchantments upon ſome Ponds, which were not as yet turned by <hi>Moſes</hi> into Blood.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60246:66"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſet he his heart to this alſo.</hi>] Here is the reaſon why his heart was not moved by this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. He did not ſeriouſly conſider what <hi>Moſes</hi> had done, and examine the Difference between the Effect of his Power, and that of the Magicians. Which was the cauſe that <hi>his heart was hardned</hi> (as we read before) as all Mens are, who will think of nothing; but only to have their own Humour ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And all the Egyptians digged round about the River for Water to drink,</hi> &amp;c.] The whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was forced to try to get Water to quench their thirſt, by this great labour. How it ſucceeded we are not told; but it is likely they found clear Water, by percolation through the Earth. For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote only the Pits that were then in being, when <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtretcht out his Rod: which had no effect upon thoſe which were digged afterwards. Why they did not ſetch it from <hi>Goſhen,</hi> if there was any clear Water there (as we cannot but think there was, for the uſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) is not eaſie to determine. Their Pride perhaps would not ſuffer them, till they had tried other ways, to ſupply their wants.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And ſeven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had ſmitten the River.</hi>] The Rod of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> could effect nothing without the LORD; by whoſe Power this Change was made in the Waters. Which laſted <hi>ſeven</hi> days before this Plague was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. By which means they were convinced that all the Waters were really corrupted: and they felt the heavy Effects of it, in a grievous ſtench, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Labour in digging Pits all about the River. Whether <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at laſt begged to have this Plague removed, or no, we are not told. It is likely he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60246:67"/>was ſo obſtinate, that he would not ſtoop to ask this favour of them: which might be the reaſon it laſted ſo long: to ſee whether he would be moved to humble himſelf ſo far. To which when he would not yield, God took it away, to make room for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtroke: or, as ſome think, it continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Plague of <hi>Frogs;</hi> and were both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved upon his Petition.</p>
               <p>It is a weak Conjecture of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, from theſe Words, that all the <hi>Ten</hi> Plagues laſted <hi>ſeven days</hi> apiece; which is plainly contrary to the Story.</p>

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>AND the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes.] Who attended upon the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, every day, to know his Pleaſure. And after the <hi>ſeven</hi> days (mentioned <hi>v.</hi> laſt, of the foregoing Chapter) were fulfilled; the LORD commanded him to Addreſs himſelf again to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and to threaten him with a new Puniſhment; which was inflicted upon the XXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Month; and taken away the day after, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and ſay unto him, Thus ſaith the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.] The very ſame Meſſage, in effect, which he had delivered to him before, V.I. VII. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And if thou refuſe to let them go, behold,</hi> &amp;c.] He again threatens the Plague before he inflicts it; both that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might know it came not by chance, but by the determinate Counſel of God; and that he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60246:67"/>might prevent it by Repentance and Submiſſion to God's Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will ſmite.</hi>] This word commonly ſignifies in the Scripture Language, <hi>to kill;</hi> but here only to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect grievouſly.</hi> See LXXVIII <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. where to <hi>deſtroy them,</hi> ſignifies to annoy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All thy Borders.</hi>] Every part of his Country, to the utmoſt extent of it, <hi>i.e.</hi> in all places where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> dwelt. For it is not likely the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were infeſted with them. See <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With Frogs.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Tſaphadéa</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, as <hi>Eben Ezra</hi> thinks, an Egyptian Fiſh: which ſome will have to be a <hi>Crocodile:</hi> As <hi>Gaulmyn</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Annnotations</hi> on the <hi>Life and Death of</hi> Moſes, <hi>p.</hi> 256. But this is undoubtedly falſe; for they could not infeſt them in that manner, as is deſcribed in the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the River ſhall bring forth.</hi>] Under the Name of the <hi>River,</hi> is comprehended all the <hi>Streams, Ponds, Lakes,</hi> and other <hi>Waters</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 5.) For moſt of them came, one way or other, out of the River: they having little Rain in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frogs abundantly.</hi>] The <hi>Nile</hi> naturally produced <hi>Frogs,</hi> but ſuch great abundance of them as ſilled the Country, was miraculous; eſpecially being produced on a ſudden; and their going out of the River and Fields, into the Cities and Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ſtill more miraculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which ſhall go up.</hi>] Out of the River: which lay lower than the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And come into thine Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This explains, what he meant by <hi>ſmiting</hi> in the foregoing Verſe: <hi>viz.</hi> inflicting a ſore Plague, more grievous than the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60246:68"/>former. For that ſpoiled only their Water, but not their other Liquors: whereas this made them uneaſie Day and Night, in every place; whether they ſate, or walkt, or lay down, or did eat and drink. For their very <hi>Dough</hi> (as we tranſlate the word of this Verſe, in the <hi>Margin</hi>) was infeſted with them, as ſoon as they had kneaded it; and ſo was their Drink in all likelyhood, as ſoon as it was poured into their Cups. Nay, they got into their <hi>Ovens:</hi> ſo that for the preſent, I ſuppoſe, they could not bake their bread.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the Frogs ſhall come up both upon thee, and upon thy People,</hi> &amp;c.] They came not meerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Houſes, but crawled upon their Perſons. And here it is obſervable, that this Plague is limited to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi>) the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> one would think by theſe words, being exempted from it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] No doubt, <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the foregoing Meſſage unto <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but he, it ſeems, turned away, and would give no Anſwer: For here immediately follows a new Order (which God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps gave <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the ſpot, as we ſpeak, before he returned home) to inflict the Plague he had bid him threaten.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſtretched forth his hand.</hi>] He, as the Miniſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> (who was to him as God, IV. 16.) inflicted this Plague upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Over the Waters.</hi>] He did not go to every place, where there was Water, but ſtood by the River, and ſtretcht his Rod over it, towards every part of the Country (as <hi>Eben Ezra</hi> rightly explains it) and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately God effected what <hi>Moſes</hi> had denounced.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60246:68"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Frogs came up, and covered the Land of</hi> Egypt.] That is, there were vaſt numbers of them came up: for they did not ſo cover the Land, but there was room for more; which the Magicians counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited. The Jews think here was, <hi>Menſura pro Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura,</hi> like for like, as we ſpeak. For they ſay it was a piece of their Bondage, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when they pleaſed, ſent them a fiſhing: and now God made the River ſpawn nothing but Frogs. Whoſe very croaking, others of them think, put the Egyptians in mind of the Cries of the poor Children whom they barbarouſly murdered.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the Magicians did ſo with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,</hi> &amp;c.] They ſhould rather have ſhown their skill in removing the Frogs, or deſtroying thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought. Which one would think <hi>Pharaoh</hi> expected from them; for they being unable to do this, he betook himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats to take them away: which he would never have done, if their power had not quite failed, and been unable to give him any relief. So <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> obſerves, he called for <hi>Moſes; becauſe he ſaw the Magicians had only added to the Plague, but could not diminiſh it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Then</hi> Pharaoh <hi>called for</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and ſaid, intreat the LORD, that he may take away the Frogs,</hi> &amp;c.] He that had proudly ſaid not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>Who is the LORD?</hi> &amp;c. V. 2. now ſays, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the LORD,</hi> &amp;c. This was an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the LORD ſent them; and that he only had power to remove them. In the former Plague, he did enough to make <hi>Pharaoh</hi> know he was the LORD, VII. 17. but this had that effect upon him for the preſent: which made him earneſtly intreat
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60246:69"/>thoſe, whom he had ſcorned, to become Interceſſors to God for him and his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will let the People go, that they may do Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto the LORD.</hi>] This was not his ſetled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but the preſent Danger made him conſent to it: For if the Frogs had continued long, there had been no living in the Country. As appears from what we read in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> out of <hi>Heraclides Lembus</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> VIII. <hi>Deipnoſ. Cap.</hi> 2.) who ſays the whole Country of <hi>Paeonia</hi> and <hi>Dardania</hi> were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Frogs, which God rained down from Heaven in ſuch abundance, that the Houſes and High-ways were full of them. They ſpent ſome time in killing of them; and, by keeping their Doors ſhut, they made a ſhift for a while to bear this Calamity: but when it did no good, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. all their Veſſels were full of them, and they mingled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Meat, whether boil'd or roaſt; and they could tread no where but upon Frogs, they left their Country; being forced to it alſo, by the ſtench of the Frogs when they died.</p>
               <p>They that would ſee more of this, out of ſeveral other Authours, may conſult <hi>Bonfrerius</hi> upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place: and <hi>Bochartus</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> 2. <hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 661, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>Glory over me, when ſhall I intreat for thee.</hi>] Do thou appoint the time when I ſhall pray for thee, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> tranſlates it; and ſo doth the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Onkelos,</hi> and the LXX. who differ from the Hebrew Text in words only, not in ſenſe. For by adding the word <hi>ſaying</hi> (as we do in VII <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. where there is the ſame expreſſion) this Paraphraſe of <hi>Bochart</hi> is very proper, (<hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> 2. <hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.)
<q>though it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60246:69"/>belongs not to thee to determine the time of thy Deliverance, which depends wholly upon the Will and Pleaſure of God; yet I, who am his Miniſter, give thee leave to take ſo much upon thee, as <hi>to preſcribe what time thou pleaſeſt, for the removal of this Plague.</hi>
                  </q> For thus he thinks <hi>Moſes</hi> his words are to be tranſlated, <hi>Glory over me, by telling me, when I ſhall intercede for thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw perhaps that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was much addicted to Aſtrologers, who fancied all things here below to be governed by the Motion and Influence of the Stars: and therefore would have him name the time; that he might be ſatisfied there was no day nor hour under ſuch an ill Aſpect, but he could prevail with God, at any Moment he thought good to pitch upon, to Deliver him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonfrerius,</hi> I think, hath expreſſed in ſhort the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe of the Hebrew words, <hi>Tibi hunc honorem defero, ut eligas quando,</hi> &amp;c. I will do thee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that thou may'ſt aſſign the time. And our Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> ſtill ſhorter, <hi>Glory over me,</hi> that is, ſaith he, <hi>you ſhall command me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, to morrow.</hi>] But why not on that very day? all Men naturally deſiring to be inſtantly relieved from their Sufferings. Perhaps he thought (as we ſaid before) to try <hi>Moſes</hi> his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; believing the next day not to be ſo lucky as the preſent, on which <hi>Moſes</hi> had condeſcended to his Requeſt. Or it might now be towards night, when he called for <hi>Moſes:</hi> who, he thought, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome time to pray to God, for what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be it according to thy word.</hi>] Thou ſhalt have thy deſire.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60246:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thou mayeſt know there is none like unto the LORD our God.</hi>] Mayeſt no longer depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Magicians and their Gods: being convinced, that our God alone, whom we call JEHOVAH, can wound and heal.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And the Frogs ſhall depart from thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This demonſtrated the power of <hi>Moſes</hi> with God, that he could as certainly foretel the removal of the Frogs, as he had done the bringing them upon the Land.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>went out from</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.] To the place, it is likely, where <hi>Moſes</hi> was wont to attend upon the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>cried unto the LORD becauſe of the Frogs.</hi>] In the Hebrew the words are, <hi>Cried to him about the buſineſs,</hi> or the matter, <hi>of the Frogs,</hi> which God had ſent upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Or, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, <hi>concerning the Frogs,</hi> which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould be removed: as if the words ſhould be tranſlated thus, <hi>He cried unto the LORD concerning what he ſaid about the Frogs, and appointed unto</hi> Pharaoh. For ſo the word <hi>Sham</hi> in XV. 25. ſignifies to <hi>appoint</hi> or <hi>propoſe,</hi> and ſo the LXX. here tranſlate the words (which we render <hi>had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Pharaoh) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> Pharaoh.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the LORD did according to the word of</hi> Moſes.] So powerful was he with God in Prayer, as the Heathens themſelves obſerved, from this Story. See what I obſerved out of <hi>Numenius,</hi> VII. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Frogs died,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Egyptians</hi> could not kill them; but God took away their breath: yet not removing them from the places where they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60246:70"/>were, but leaving them dead there. As appears by what follows:</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And they gathered them together on heaps.</hi>] That they might carry them, it is likely, into the River; and ſo they might go down into the Sea. God could have diſſolved them into Duſt (if he had pleaſed) or ſwept them into the River from whence they came; or made them quite vaniſh in an inſtant. But he would have them lye dead before their eyes; as a Token they were real Frogs, and no Illuſion of their ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Land ſtank.</hi>] This was a further ſenſible Evidence, that they were real Frogs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>But when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw that there was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite.</hi>] That he was freed from the great ſtrait, in which he was. For the Hebrew word for <hi>reſpite,</hi> ſignifies <hi>breathing</hi> or <hi>inlargement;</hi> and makes the ſenſe to be this: that when the burden that preſſed him was taken off, ſo that he could take his breath, he was of another mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hardned his heart, and hearkned not unto them,</hi> &amp;c.] Was not ſo good as his word, (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) but returned to his former Reſolution, not to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. Which Reſolution grew ſo much more ſtubborn and obſtinate, than it had been before; by how much the Plague of the Frogs had ſoftned his heart, and inclined it to yield to God, more than the two former Miracles had done.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay unto</hi> Aaron.] The LORD ſeems to have given <hi>Pharaoh</hi> no warning of this Plague; but to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted it immediately upon the removal of the Frogs, <hi>viz.</hi> on the <hi>Twenty ſeventh day</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Month. For his breach of Faith, was ſuch an high Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And the Magicians did ſo,</hi> &amp;c.] Attempted and endeavoured to do ſo; by uſing their wonted Invocations and Rites of Incantation. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying among the Jews is very frivolous, That <hi>Daemons have no power over Creatures ſo ſmall as Lice.</hi> The meaning of which, <hi>Gaulmyn</hi> thinks, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not underſtand; which, according to the Principles of the ancient Magick, was this: That all Animals had a particular <hi>Genius</hi> preſiding over them, by whoſe Aſſiſtance their Worſhippers could do any thing among that ſort of Creatures. But this is meant only of perfect Animals, not of Inſects (among whom they reckon'd <hi>Lice</hi>) which had no ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power waiting on them. But if there had been any ſuch Notions then, theſe <hi>Magicians</hi> ſure would have underſtood it; and not fruitleſly have attempted that, which they had no hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they could not.</hi>] Though they had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the former Wonders; yet here a ſtop is put to their Power, ſo that they themſelves confeſs their weakneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So there were Lice upon Man, and upon Beast.</hi>] This ſeems to ſuggeſt, that ſince they could not produce any new Lice, they attempted to remove thoſe, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought upon the Country. But they fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that alſo: for notwithſtanding all that they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60246:72"/>could do, both Men and Beaſts were peſtered with Lice. The Hebrews ſay (in <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes) that this Plague was inflicted upon the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> for another piece of Oppreſſion which they exerciſed on the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> to whom they ſaid, <hi>Go, ſweep our Houſes, and ſweep our Streets,</hi> &amp;c. therefore God made Lice to cover the Earth a Cubit deep. But this favours too much of their fabulous invention. It is more pertinent to obſerve, that though we read of particular Perſons, who, for great Crimes, were puniſhed with the Plague of Lice, (See <hi>Huctius L.</hi> II. <hi>Quaeſt. Cap.</hi> XII. <hi>n.</hi> 12.) yet we do not find in any Story a whole Nation infeſted with them; and that both Men and Beaſts, without Exception: the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians themſelves, in all likelyhood, being ſorely aſſlicted with them: which made them cry out as here follows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Then the Magicians ſaid unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>This is the ſinger of God.</hi>] The ſame with what is called in other places of Scripture, <hi>the hand of God,</hi> CIX <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. that is, his Power. There are thoſe (particularly <hi>Bochartus</hi>) who think theſe Magicians did not by theſe words, give Glory to God: but thought to ſave their own Credit with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by telling him, that it was not <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were too hard for them, but a Divine Power ſuperiour to them all. To this purpoſe <hi>Jonathan.</hi> But they ought then to have been ſenſible that the Power which they dealt withal, was far from being Supream: being unable to aſſiſt them upon all occaſions. And, no doubt, God intended to confound them, by taking that time to diſable them, when they leaſt expected it. For why ſhould not their Power have extended to ſuch a ſmall thing as this, when they had done
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60246:72"/>greater? But God would not let them always abuſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with their Illuſions; and gave them a check, when they thought themſelves moſt ſure of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s heart was hardned.</hi>] One would have rather expected to have heard, that his heart began to relent, when he ſaw his Magicians not only puzzled, but quite bafled; ſo that they owned <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> acted by a Power above theirs. But this it was, not to ſtick to the good Reſolutions which had lately been wrought in him, <hi>v.</hi> 8. from which he not only revolted, but grew more reſolute not to yield to God. The effect of which was this further Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: it being natural for evil Men, who reſiſt the Means of their Cure, to grow worſe and worſe affected.</p>
               <p>This Miracle alſo of the Lice, being more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> than terrible, might haply be the reaſon (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> conjectures) that he did not intreat <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him: as he had done upon the ſight of the Frogs; and as he ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way did after he felt the next Plague of the Flies.</p>
               <p>I cannot but add alſo this further reflection of his, (<hi>Book</hi> X. on the <hi>Creed, Chap.</hi> XL.) that though <hi>the ſinger of God</hi> was very remarkable in producing the Lice, which the Magicians could not, yet it was no way remarkable in hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart. For it is neither ſaid, nor intimated, that <hi>the ſinger of God hardned it;</hi> but <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>heart was hardned,</hi> that is, remained obſtinate. The Cauſe of which was his <hi>not hearkning to them,</hi> as it had been before, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lo, he cometh forth to the Water.</hi>] This confirms what was ſaid there, that in the Morning it was uſual with him to walk out by the River; either for his Refreſhment, or for his Devotion. Perhaps, that after waſhing, he might worſhip the Riſing Sun. For <hi>Moſes</hi> is commanded, to riſe up <hi>early</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſent himſelf before him.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60246:73"/>other things, to <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>darken.</hi> From whence the Even time is called <hi>Ereb.</hi> And therefore, with great reaſon, he approves of the LXX. Verſion, who tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This Plague the Jews ſay (in the forenamed Book of <hi>The Life of</hi> Moſes) was ſent upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe of the hard Service they made the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> undergo, in feeding their Cattle.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And I will ſever in that day the Land of</hi> Goſhen, <hi>in which my People dwell,</hi> &amp;c.] Here now the diſtinguiſhing Mercy of God to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> is plainly expreſſed; which is to be underſtood in the foregoing Plagues.

And it was the more wonderful, becauſe there was ſuch ſtore of Cattle in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> whoſe Dung is apt to breed Flies.</p>

Which was very grievous and noiſom, as appears by the following words; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by his willingneſs to grant more than he had done before, that he might be rid of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And the LORD did ſo.</hi>] Here is no mention of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s ſtretching out his Rod, (as at other times) but this was done immediately by God himſelf: That the <hi>Egpytians</hi> might not imagine there was any ſecret Vertue in the Rod; but aſcribe all to the Divine Power.</p>

But there is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection lies againſt this Interpretation, that long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes</hi> his time the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themſelves did offer all the fore-mentioned Creatures to their Gods: For <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates (in his <hi>Euterpe, Cap.</hi> XLI.) after what manner they Sacrificed an <hi>Ox</hi> in his time: and though ſome parts of the Country abſtained from <hi>Sheep,</hi> yet they ſacrificed <hi>Goats;</hi> as, on the contrary, others abſtained from Goats and ſacrificed Sheep. See upon XLIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. Therefore it may be a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether theſe words do not refer only to the Rites and Ceremonies of Sacrificing; and to the qualities and condition of the Beaſts which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: about which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in after Ages were very curious. For the ſame <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us (in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60246:75"/>ſame Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> XXXVIII.) how the Sacrifices were examined by the Prieſt, and none allowed to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but thoſe which had his mark upon them.

                  </gap>, <hi>that if a Beast were found to have one hair Black or white, it was judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit for Sacrifice.</hi> The forenamed <hi>Herodotus</hi> indeed ſaith, they would not Sacrifice <hi>Cows,</hi> becauſe they were ſacred to <hi>Iſis:</hi> which ſhows that in his time, there was great Superſtition about ſuch Creatures; ſo that none durſt offer the leaſt Violence to them. But, as we have no Evidence, that in the days of <hi>Moſes</hi> they were infected with ſuch Opinions, ſo their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing ſuch Creatures, as the Jews did long after his days, and all Mankind had done from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſeems to be a prejudice againſt that ſenſe of the words, which is generally put upon them. But there were ſo many various ways of Sacrificing in the World, that it is very probable the <hi>Egyptians</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much from the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> who might offer alſo (it's likely) ſuch Creatures as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought unclean; whereby they might be inraged at their Profaneneſs.</p>

Which if it had continued long, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> muſt have left their Country, to preſerve themſelves.

               <p>
                  <hi>The hand of the LORD is upon thy Cattle,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, he will ſmite them, (which is done by the <hi>hand</hi>) and is juſt ready to do the Execution.

               <p>
                  <hi>A very grievous Murrain.</hi>] That is, a great <hi>Plague,</hi> or <hi>Peſtilence</hi> (as we call it, in Mankind) of which abundance of Cattle ſhall die. For ſo the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>grievous</hi>) is uſed for <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> See VIII. 24. But the greater the Number was that died, the more <hi>grievous,</hi> no doubt, was the Calamity: God intending to deal more ſeverely than formerly with him, becauſe he had been guilty of a fraudulent Contempt of his former ſolemn Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, VIII. 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the LORD ſhall ſever between the Cattle of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Cattle of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c.] See VIII. 22. This was the greater wonder (as the word imports) becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> were mingled together in the Land of <hi>Goſhen:</hi> and their Cattle breathed in the ſame Air, and drank of the ſame Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which it appeared this Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was not natural; but proceeded, as was ſaid before, from the hand of God.</p>

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the LORD appointed a ſet time.</hi>] That they might know, this ſtroke came from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saying, to morrow the LORD ſhall do this thing in the Land.</hi>] This Plague was threatned upon the <hi>first</hi> day of the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Month, (which afterwards was changed into the <hi>first</hi> Month of the Year) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the <hi>ſecond</hi> Day.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And all the Cattle of</hi> Egypt <hi>died.</hi>] Some ſurvived, it is plain from <hi>v.</hi> 19. Therefore the meaning is, either all that were in the Field, (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) not thoſe in the Cities or Houſes: or, rather a great many of all ſorts of Cattle, as <hi>Druſius</hi> expounds it, <hi>Omne genus,</hi> all kinds: as the word <hi>all</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Vide L.</hi> 2. <hi>Animadverſ.

               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſent, and behold there was not one of the Cattle of the Iſraelites dead.</hi>] We do not find that he ſent to make any ſuch Enquiry in the former Plagues. It is likely he ſlighted what they ſaid, and would not do them the Honour to ſeem to believe them. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo had ſaid nothing of this difference God would make between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and them, till the laſt Plague; when the Flies were ſo buſie and vexatious, that it made Travel uneaſie: as it was likewiſe in the two other before that, when they could tread upon nothing but <hi>Frogs,</hi> or <hi>Lice.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the heart of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>was hardned.</hi>] One would rather have expected to hear that it relented; becauſe he took the pains to ſatisfie himſelf that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every thing foretold by <hi>Moſes</hi> was come to paſs: which looks as if he meant, upon the Truth of that Information, to alter his Courſe. This Plague like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was much heavier than all, or moſt, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60246:78"/>which were rather more noiſom and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> ſpeaks) than detrimental to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his People. For we do not read before this time, of the death of any uſeful Creatures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Fiſhes when the Waters were turned into Blood: And that Calamity was not ſo univerſal neither, being only in the River (and ſome think only near the Court) as this Murrain, which was all over the Country; and did them a far greater Miſchief. But having accuſtomed himſelf to do evil, he grew ſtill more obſtinate and hardned in Pride and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For he doth not ſo much as pray to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this Plague; which had done all the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he thought, that was deſigned; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended perhaps to repair his loſs, out of the Flocks and Herds of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> which haply might make him leſs affected with this wonder, than he had been with ſome of the former.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron.] The former Plague having ſo little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his proud and ſtubborn heart, the Lord inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any further Meſſage to him (as being now in <hi>Proceſs</hi> of <hi>Sentence,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to bring another Judgment upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> more dreadful and noyſom than any of the reſt had been.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And let</hi> Moſes <hi>ſprinkle it.</hi>] The Jews think God imployed <hi>him</hi> only in Executing this Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much heavier than all the foregoing. But both
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60246:79"/>he and <hi>Aaron</hi> being commanded to take Aſhes (in the words foregoing) as we read they did <hi>v.</hi> 10. it is more probable they both ſprinkled: and ſo the meaning is, let <hi>Moſes</hi> (as well as <hi>Aaron</hi>) ſprinkle it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Towards Heaven.</hi>] To ſhow that the Plague came from thence.</p>

                  <hi>In the ſight of</hi> Pharaoh.] That he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And it ſhall become ſmall dust, in all the Land of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c.] Inſtead of theſe Aſhes which they threw up into the Air, there came down a ſmall <hi>Sleet</hi> (as we call it) like that of Snow, or the Hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froſt, which ſcalded the Fleſh of Man and Beaſt; and raiſed a Bliſter in every part upon which it fell. The Poiſon of which penetrating into the Fleſh, made ſore ſwellings like thoſe we now call <hi>Bubo's.</hi> Inſomuch that, as <hi>Philo</hi> underſtood it (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Vita Moſis</hi>) they were full of Blotches from Head to Foot. Certain it is, that the Hebrew word <hi>Schechni</hi> ſignifies an Inflammation, that made a Tumor or <hi>Bile</hi> (as we tranſlate the word XIII <hi>Levit.</hi> 18, 19.) which turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch a grievous Ulcer, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of it afterwards as an unuſual Plague, which he calls the <hi>Botch of</hi> Egypt, XXVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obſerves, that in the Book of <hi>Job</hi> (II. 7, 8.) it ſignifies only a burning Itch, or an inflamed Scab: an intolerable dry Itch, which his Nails could not ſcratch off, but he was glad to make uſe of a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd to scrub himſelf. But then he confeſſes, that this <hi>Schechni</hi> here ſpoken of, was higher than that, having Blains and Boils that broke out with it; which <hi>Job</hi>'s had not. So that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he thinks, were vexed with a double Puniſhment at once; aking
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60246:79"/>Boils, and a fiery Itch. But our Interpreters take it otherwiſe, and ſay that <hi>Job</hi> alſo was ſmote with <hi>Boils:</hi> which in concluſion, perhaps, had a Scab that itched very much.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And they took Aſhes of the Furnace,</hi> &amp;c.] This Plague was inflicted about the <hi>third</hi> Day of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Month, according to Archbiſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: who thinks it probable (as many others do) that from hence the Tale was ſpread among the Heathens, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drove the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe they were Scabby; leſt the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould ſpread all over the Country. For they endeavoured, in future Ages, to make it be believed, that what befel themſelves, was a Plague upon the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And the Magicians could not ſtand before</hi> Moſes, <hi>becauſe of the Boils,</hi> &amp;c.] This Plague ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, as well as the reſt of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and that in the Preſence of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> (as theſe words ſeem to import) which perfectly confounded them. For though, ſince the Plague of <hi>Lice,</hi> which they could not counterfeit, we read of no attempt they ventured to make, to vie Miracles with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> yet they ſtill continued about <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (it appears from this place) and endeavoured to ſettle him in his Reſolution, not to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him, perhaps, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> for the preſent had found out ſome Secret beyond their skill, they ſhould at laſt be too hard for him. But now, being on a ſudden ſmote with theſe Ulcers, they were ſo amazed, that we do not find they appeared again to look <hi>Moſes</hi> in the face. For now, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>their Folly was manifeſted to all Men,</hi> 1 Tim. III. 8, 9. In that they could not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60246:80"/>from this terrible ſtroke; whick publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeizing on them before <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Servants, rendred them ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, that we never hear more of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the LORD hardned the heart of</hi> Pharaoh, &amp;c.] If we ſuppoſe that the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had hitherto confirmed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, were forced to withdraw in great Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they were ſmitten with the Boils; one would have thought the next thing we ſhould have heard, would have been that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> relented. But here is not the leaſt token of that mentioned in this Hiſtory, but rather the expreſs contrary; that God was ſo angry with him, that he himſelf hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart, which he had never done before. This hardning therefore which is ſaid to be God's doing, was ſomething ſure very extraordinary. Yet it was not an infuſion of any bad Qualities or ungodly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions into <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, but only that God did not vouchſafe him thoſe Convictions that might have ſoftned him, and gave him up to his own hearts luſts; and likewiſe ordered things ſo to fall out, that he ſhould hereafter be made by them, more and more obdurate. For he had hardned himſelf againſt <hi>five</hi> Plagues; therefore God leaves him to himſelf, and reſolves he ſhall continue in his hardneſs. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he doth not ſo much as deſire to be freed from this Plague, no more than he had done in the former, which was nothing ſo grievous. The effect of ſuch Induration is well expreſſed by <hi>Dav. Chytraeus</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Cor induratum est, quod nec compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione ſcinditur,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>An hardned heart is neither cut by Compunction, nor ſoftned by any ſenſe of Piety. It is neither moved by Prayers and Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60246:80"/>nor yields to Threatnings, nor feels the ſmart of Scourges. It is ungrateful for Benefits; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to Counſels; ſullen to Judgments; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to things moſt baſe; fearleſs of Dangers: For getful of things paſt; negligent of things preſent; improvident for the future. In ſhort, it neither fears God, nor reverences Man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the LORD had ſpoken unto</hi> Moſes.] The Margin of our Bible directs the Reader to IV. 21. where God ſaith, <hi>I will harden,</hi> &amp;c. See there; (and III. 19.) And obſerve that all along from thence to this place, it is very often ſaid, in the cloſe of the former Plagues, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>heart was hardned as the LORD had ſaid,</hi> (VII. 13, 22. VIII. 15, 19, 32.) But this is the firſt time that it is ſaid, <hi>the LORD hardned the heart of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>as he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto</hi> Moſes. Which different Cloſe gives us to underſtand, that now, after the Plague of <hi>Blains,</hi> the Sentence of Deſtruction was irreverſibly denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him; and God reſolved to diſpoſe things ſo, that he ſhould not repent, but run headlong to his ruin.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>riſe up early in the Morning.</hi>] That he might ſpeak with Pharaoh before he went abroad; or at his going out of his Palace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Let my People go that they may ſerve me.</hi>] But why doth he ſend any more Meſſages to him, may ſome ſay, after he had hardned him, and knew he would not ſubmit? To which Dr. <hi>Jael ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60246:81"/>juſt as he had done with the poor oppreſſed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered his firſt Meſſage to him. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> immediately forbids his Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters to give them any Straw, and yet required the ſame Tale of Bricks, which they made when they had Straw enough. The Lord in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſame Obedience of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after he had deprived him of Underſtanding, and of all good Motions, which he had demanded of him before, or at the firſt Exhibition of his Signs and Wonders. And this is that which gave occaſion to the Queſtion we find IX <hi>Rom.</hi> 19. <hi>Why doth he yet find fault?</hi> To which there needs no further Satisfaction in this place.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>For I will at this time.</hi>] For now I will begin to ſend more terrible Plagues upon thee, one after another, till I have deſtroyed thee.</p>

               <p>Ver. 15, 16. <hi>For now I will ſtretch out my hand, that I may ſmite thee, and thy People with Peſtilence,</hi> &amp;c.] I do not ſee how this Tranſlation can be maintained; for we do not read, that God, after this, ſent a new <hi>Peſtilence</hi> upon <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and the Hebrew word <hi>deber</hi> ſignifies nothing elſe. This therefore muſt needs refer to the Time paſt: and the ſenſe of theſe <hi>three</hi> Verſes (14, 15, 16.) muſt be this; <hi>I will ſend more Plagues on thee, and on thy Servants,</hi> (as was threatned <hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>for the truth is, I had now ſtretched out my hand to deſtroy both thee and thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by my late Peſtilence, wherewith you had all been cut off, had it not been that I reſerve you for further Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: for which very cauſe I made thee to ſtand, when thou wast falling</hi> (i. e. <hi>kept thee from dying</hi>) <hi>that I might ſend more Plagues upon thee, and make thy deſtruction more notorious to all the World.</hi> See <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> and <hi>Theod. Hackſpan,</hi> and <hi>Fr. Junius</hi> alſo, who tranſlate theſe words, <hi>I had ſmitten thee and thy People with Peſtilence,</hi> (i. e. when he deſtroyed their Cattle with a Murrain) and then <hi>hadst thou been cut off from the Earth,</hi> as it follows in the end of this Verſe; that is, when the Boils broke out upon the Magicians.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And in very deed for this cauſe have I raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee up.</hi>] In the Hebrew the words are, <hi>I have made thee ſtand:</hi> that is, preſerved thee alive, when the Peſtilence would have cut thee off, as the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain did thy Cattle; if I had not kept thee from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing then, that I might deſtroy thee in a more remarkable manner.

               <p>
                  <hi>And that my Name may be declared throughout all the World.</hi>] If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People had all periſhed by the Peſtilence, when the Cattle did, or died when ſmitten with Blains; the terrour of God's powerful Diſpleaſure had not been ſo viſible to all the World, as it was in overthrowing the whole Strength of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> in the red Sea.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>As yet exalteſt thou thy ſelf against my People,</hi> &amp;c.] In theſe words he returns to finiſh his Meſſage begun, <hi>v.</hi> 13. which he concludes with this Expoſtulation, which upbraids him with his ſenſleſs Obſtinacy. Which, in other words, may be thus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſed; <hi>Dost thou ſtill (notwithſtanding all that I have done to humble thee) proudly inſult over my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reſolve to keep them in Bondage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Expoſtulation, which is very ſharp and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, may ſeem to ſome unſeaſonable, now that God himſelf had hardned him, and taken his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from him; though before nothing could have been more proper, while there was a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of penetrating his heart. But God cannot loſe his right to demand that Obedience, which Men have made themſelves unable to pay: and it was but juſt he ſhould be upbraided with his Obſtinacy, even when he could not comply, becauſe he had brought upon himſelf this Puniſhment, of ſtupid Inſenſibility. See <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Behold, to morrow about this time.</hi>] As his Deſtruction was determined, ſo it was to come ſpeedily upon him; and therefore there was but one Day between this Plague and the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will ſend a very grievous Hail.</hi>] Great Hail-ſtones, falling very thick, as we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such as hath not been in</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſince the foundation thereof.</hi>] Since it hath been inhabited. This ſhows that though Rain was not frequent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet ſometimes they had both Rain and Hail alſo. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there could not have been a Compariſon made between this and former Hail, if there never had been any at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Send therefore now, and gather thy Cattle,</hi> &amp;c.] It appears by the next Verſe, that though <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his <hi>Grandees</hi> could not be moved by all theſe Judgments, yet there were ſome Perſons in the Court, who were better diſpoſed, for whoſe ſake God gives this Warning of their Danger, that they might avoid it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>He that feared the Word of the LORD among the Servants of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] That which is oppoſed to this in the next Verſe is, <hi>He that ſet not his heart unto the Word of the LORD;</hi> or, as we tranſlate it, <hi>regarded it not:</hi> i. e. did not attend to what was ſaid and done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſeriouſly conſider it. Unto which the <hi>fear of God</hi> moves all thoſe who are poſſeſſed with it; and <hi>ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> will not fail to work in Men the fear of God, and of his Judgments.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And he that regarded not the word of the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.] This was the Cauſe of the Ruin of all that periſhed; they did not ſet themſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the irreſiſtible Power of him, who inflicted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60246:83"/>ſuch terrible Judgments upon them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For at laſt they grew ſo ſtupid that they could not conſider; but were perfectly infatuated.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſtretch forth thy hand.</hi>] With his Rod in it, as it is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the next Verſe; and as he had directed on other occaſions, VIII. 16, 17. where it is ſaid, Aaron <hi>ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his and with his Rod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Towards Heaven.</hi>] To ſhow the Plague was ſent from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there may be Hail on all the Land of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c.] Here he more fully expreſſes the Damage it would do, both to Men and Beaſts, and to the <hi>Herb of the Field,</hi> which comprehends all the <hi>Trees,</hi> v. 25.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſtretched forth his Rod.</hi>] Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Aaron</hi> did it; but it was at the Command of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as his Miniſter: who ſometimes did it himſelf, and was Commanded by God ſo to do, <hi>v.</hi> 22. He gave warning of this Plague about the <hi>fourth</hi> Day of the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Month, and inflicted it upon the <hi>fifth,</hi> and removed it the <hi>ſixth.</hi> The Author of <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes, fancies that God ſent this Plague to puniſh the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for the drudgery they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in making them till their Fields for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD ſent Thunder and Hail,</hi> &amp;c.] It was no wonder there ſhould be <hi>Thunder;</hi> but the Claps of this were far more terrible, than any that had been heard before in that Country. As the <hi>Hall</hi> alſo was more ponderous, and came down with a greater force, and was mixed with Fire. Which the Author of the <hi>Book of Wiſdom</hi> obſerves (Chap. XVI.) as a thing unuſual. And herein conſiſted the miraculouſneſs of this Plague; That whereas
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60246:83"/>other Storms of <hi>Hail</hi> generally reach but a little way (ſometimes not a Mile) this ſpread it ſelf over the whole Country, <hi>v.</hi> 25. And Flaſhes of <hi>Lightning</hi> were not only mingled with it, but <hi>Fire</hi> ran upon the Ground, and killed their Cattle, (LXXVIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.) when at the ſame time, all the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> though a part of that Country, felt nothing of this Storm, <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD rained Hail upon the Land of</hi> Egypt.] This is repeated, to ſhow that it fell as thick as Rain, and was not a meer ſhowr, but a continual Hail: and that this was the principal part of this Plague, being alone mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 22. and 26. (where nothing is ſaid of <hi>Thunder</hi> or <hi>Fire</hi>) and put in the firſt place by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> both in LXXVIII. 48. and CV. 32.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And the Hail ſmote,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every Man and Beaſt that was in the Field, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſmote every Herb, and broke every Tree of the Field.</hi>] Eſpecially their Vines and Figtrees, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> tells us, LXXVIII. 47. CV. 33. Very great Hailſtones have fall'n in ſeveral Countries; ſome of a prodigious bigneſs (as credible Hiſtorians relate) whereby ſome living Creatures have here and there been killed: but none ever made ſuch a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as this Storm did. Yet we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it as if no green thing eſcaped, nor a Bough of any Tree was left: but the meaning is, that a great many of every kind were deſtroyed; though ſome, as appears by the following Chapter, ſtill remained.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60246:84"/>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Only in the Land of</hi> Goſhen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] So that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that lived among them, fared the better (it is thought) at this time for their ſake.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſent and called for</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron.] This is no more than he had done ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times before, (VIII. 8, 25.) but it may ſeem ſtrange he ſhould do it now, after the LORD had hardned his heart. The cleareſt account of it is, that he acted now as a Man diſtracted and frighted out of his Wits; which made him rave and cry out for help, in very paſſionate words, without any ſerious meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have ſinned this time,</hi> &amp;c.] The meaning is not, that he had not ſinned before; but, <hi>I now acknowledge my Offence, and the Juſtice of God in puniſhing the wickedneſs of me and of my People.</hi> Which Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth not argue any tenderneſs of heart; but was extorted by the horrible Fright he was in of being undone, if he did not make ſome Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Intreat the LORD (for it is enough).</hi>] Or, beſeech him that what I have already ſuffered may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there be no more mighty Thundrings and Hail.</hi>] The words import frightful Claps of Thunder, which ſounded as if God was angry with them; eſpecially ſince the Hail fell like Thunder-bolts upon their Heads, and ſtruck thoſe down that walkt abroad. This was the reaſon that he begg'd their Prayers: For he and his Servants could not always continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doors; and while the Hail laſted, there was no Safety abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will let you go.</hi>] Not quite away; but three days Journey into the Wilderneſs, as they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And ye ſhall ſtay no longer.</hi>] He promiſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them immediately.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto him, as ſoon as I am gone out of the City.</hi>] By this he demonſtrated the great Power of God, who he knew would protect him, from receiving any harm by the Thunder, Lightning and Hail, which killed all others that went abroad into the Fields.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will ſpread forth my hands unto the LORD.</hi>] This was an ancient Poſture of Supplication, in all Nations (as many Learned Men have ſhown) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men declared, that God is the Giver of all good things; and that they hoped to receive Help from him. For our Hands are the Inſtruments, whereby we receive any Gift that is beſtowed upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thou mayeſt know, how that the Earth is the LORD's.</hi>] Have a demonſtration (which was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make him know) that the LORD governs all things: as appeared by the ceaſing of this dreadful ſtorm, upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prayers to God, as well as by the powring of it in ſuch violence upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>But as for thee, and thy Servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.</hi>] The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Court he knew, would continue as obſtinate as their Prince; though ſome of them had ſome ſenſe of God, and of his Judgments, as we read <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And the Flax and the Barley were ſmitten,</hi> &amp;c.] From hence our Learned <hi>N. Fuller</hi> gathers, that this fell out in the Month of <hi>Abib,</hi> as Archbiſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Annals.</hi> For it appears by <hi>Pliny</hi> and others, that <hi>Barley</hi> began to ripen in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in <hi>March;</hi> but <hi>Wheat</hi> not till <hi>April. Herm. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius</hi> differs from this account a little; for he thinks
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60246:85"/>(in his Treatiſe <hi>de initio anni Sabbatici</hi>) that this Hail fell in the Month of <hi>February;</hi> Flax being ſown here, and among the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>October</hi> to the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> as he obſerves out of <hi>Columella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>But the Wheat and the Rye were not ſmitten: for they were not grown up.</hi>] In the Hebrew, <hi>they were hidden;</hi> i. e. were as yet under ground, as <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> and from him <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> expound it. But that cannot be the meaning; for there was but a Months difference between the growth of Wheat and of Barley to maturity. And therefore <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath more truly expounded the meaning (<hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) that they were <hi>not yet eared:</hi> and ſo being tender and flexil, yielded to the ſtroke of the Hail; and received leſs harm than the Barley which was in <hi>the ear,</hi> and the Flax which was <hi>bolled.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Rain was not powred out.</hi>] It ſeems there was Rain together with the <hi>Hail</hi> and <hi>Fire:</hi> which made this Plague ſtill the more wonderful. Or, by Rain muſt be underſtood, the ſhowr of Hail which the Lord <hi>rained from Heaven</hi> v. 18. which ſenſe is confuted by the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw that the Rain, and the Hail, and the Thunder were ceaſed.</hi>] As ſoon as the Storm was over, and the Heavens clear again,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſinned yet more, and hardned his heart,</hi> &amp;c.] That which ſhould have made him acknowledge the Power of God (which was as apparent in ſtopping the Hail, as in powring it on his Country) made him the more contumacious. For ſeeing this danger over, he fancied there would be no more.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:60246:85"/>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And the heart of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>was hardned,</hi> &amp;c.] Continued in hardneſs; for God would not ſoften it, having reſolved ſtill to harden him, as he had began to do <hi>v.</hi> 12. and did now, X. 1. For he neither moved his heart to remember his Confeſſion, and his Promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. nor continued the means which extorted that ſeeming Repentance from him. But by granting his Deſire, to have this ſtroke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſuffered him to return to his wonted Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.</p>

                  <hi>The reſidue of that which is eſcaped,</hi> &amp;c.] By this it appears, that the Wheat and the Rye eſcaped the ſtroke of the Hail, IX. 31. ſo the Trees were not to be broken, but ſome Boughs remained.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And they ſhall fill thy Houſes,</hi> &amp;c.] The Author of <hi>the Book of Wiſdom,</hi> XVI. 9. ſeems to think that they killed Men and Women. But that miſtake, it is likely, aroſe from <hi>v.</hi> 17. which may have another Interpretation. See there. Though if
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60246:87"/>the Locuſts died in their Houſes, the ſtench of their dead Bodies was ſo offenſive, that it often bred the Peſtilence, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hieroz. L.</hi> IV. <hi>c.</hi> 3, 5.</p>

That is, all that had been ſeen in <hi>Egypt:</hi> For in other Countries, perhaps there might have been as large; if <hi>Pliny</hi> may be believed, that in <hi>India</hi> there had been ſome ſeen <hi>three</hi> foot long. The Jews in the Book called, <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes, fancy theſe to have been of ſuch a vaſt Bulk, that <hi>their Jaw-teeth were like thoſe of Lions.</hi> But it's likely <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks here only of their multitude. For the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> hath ſuch an Expreſſion, when he ſpeaks alſo of their being without number, I <hi>Joel</hi> 6. <hi>Whoſe Teeth are the Teeth of a Lion:</hi> i. e. they devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things greedily and ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he turned himſelf, and went out from</hi> Pharaoh.] Either <hi>Moſes</hi> did not ſtay for an Anſwer, knowing he would give him none better than formerly; or <hi>Pharaoh</hi> anſwered ſo churliſhly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> haſtily turned about (as the words ſeem to import) and went away in ſome indignation.</p>

                  <hi>Knoweſt thou not yet, that</hi> Egypt <hi>is deſtroyed?</hi>] Doſt thou not conſider, that ſo many Plagues have ruined our Country?</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>were brought again unto</hi> Pharaoh, &amp;c.] Upon this Advice, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be called back again: and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let them go, with ſome Limitations; to which <hi>Moſes</hi> could not agree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But who are they that ſhall go?</hi>]. In the Hebrew the words are, <hi>but who and who?</hi> that is, Name the particulars. For his Covetouſneſs would not ſuffer the whole Nation to go; but he would keep ſome faſt in his hands, as a Pledge for the Return of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, we will go with our young and our old,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with our Flocks and with our Herds,</hi> &amp;c.] The reaſon of this large Demand is given in the end of this Verſe. They did not know what and how often they muſt Sacrifice to the LORD: and therefore it was neceſſary their Flocks and Herds ſhould go with them. And they being <hi>to hold a Feast unto the LORD,</hi> none of them were to be abſent from the Solemnity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hold a Feast unto the LORD.</hi>] It appears from V. 1, 3. that it was to be a <hi>Feast</hi> upon a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> of which every one was to be a partaker.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Let the LORD be ſo with you, as I will let you go,</hi> &amp;c.] Moſt take this for a form of <hi>Imprecation;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>I

               <p>
                  <hi>Look you to it, for evil is before you.</hi>] It is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whether he meant <hi>evil,</hi> that they deſigned againſt him; or, which he deſigned againſt them. The former beſt agrees with what follows; as if he had ſaid, <hi>you intend a Rebellion;</hi> therefore I will let none but the Men go. Or, more plainly, <hi>it is viſible you deſign ſome evil: i. e.</hi> you have conſpired to be gone, and make a Revolt. Or, it is plain and manifeſt by your very Countenances, that you intend ſome evil. If we take it the other way, for <hi>evil</hi> which he threatned to them, the meaning muſt be, <hi>Mark what I ſay, I will take a courſe with you, unleſs you be content to go and Sacrifice upon my terms;</hi> i. e. the Men only.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Not ſo.</hi>] You ſhall not have your will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go now ye that are Men and ſerve the LORD, for that you did deſire.</hi>] So he Interprets their Demand, V. 1. pretending that Women and Children needed not to attend upon Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they were driven out from</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s preſence.</hi>] It is likely he ſaid, <hi>I have no more to ſay to you;</hi> or, <hi>you know my mind, and therefore get you gone:</hi> and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60246:88"/>then commanded his Officers to thruſt them out of Doors; which they did with ſome violence. This ſhows he was in a fury; which made him neither regard God, nor Man: but reject the good Counſel his own Servants had given him, (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) as well as the Commands which <hi>Moſes</hi> from God had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſiretch out thine hand,</hi> &amp;c.] Upon this, the Lord imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered <hi>Moſes</hi> to Execute the Judgment he had denounced. Which, as I ſaid before, was threatned about the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, and inflicted upon the next; and removed on the <hi>ninth</hi> day of <hi>Abib.</hi> Compare <hi>v.</hi> 4, 13, 19.</p>

For though in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which lay <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there were great ſtore of Locuſts, yet not ſuch Numbers as were in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which lay South of it; and abounded with them more than any Country in the World. Some People there, lived upon nothing elſe but Locuſts; which were brought thither in the Spring, about the <hi>Vernal Aequinox,</hi> in vaſt quantities; partly by the Weſtern, and partly by the Southern Winds, as the ſame <hi>Bochart</hi> ſhows out of good Authors, <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>c.</hi> 3. And now it was about that time of the year, when by a Wind blowing from thoſe parts, they were brought into <hi>Egypt.</hi> See LXXVIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.</p>

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the Locuſts went up over all the Land of</hi> Egypt.] Being lifted up by the Wind (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks) they ſly in the Air in a great Cloud; which now it ſeems ſpread it ſelf over all the Land of <hi>Egypt, ſolicitè ſpectantibus populis,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For they covered the Face of the whole Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] The word in the Hebrew which we tranſlate <hi>Face,</hi> ſignifying properly <hi>the Eye,</hi> it induced <hi>Onkelos</hi> to tranſlate this Paſſage, <hi>they covered the Sun;</hi> which is the Eye of the Earth: That is, there was ſuch a thick Cloud of them before they fell, that they darkned the Sun; as when they were fall'n, <hi>they darkned the Land,</hi> as it here follows. Or, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, there were ſuch Numbers that they not only covered the Earth, but the Sun alſo. For many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mentions ſuch prodigious Clouds of them, as have ſo thickned the Sky, that the Day hath been turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Night. See <hi>Bochart.

For this was ſuch a Plague as all Men accounted, a manifeſt Token of the Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. According to that of <hi>Pliny, L.</hi> XI. <hi>c.</hi> 29. <hi>Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum irae peſtis ea intelligitur.</hi> This is taken for <hi>a Plague of the Anger of the Gods:</hi> or, as ſome Copies have it, <hi>Mira peſtis, a wonderful Plague</hi> ſent from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>

<q>Thus we all naturally think of Repenting (as <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanus</hi> here piouſly reſlects) when we are in great ſtraits; nay, and promiſe it too, till we are out of danger: when we perform little of what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as our whole Life teſtifies.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Which took away the Locuſts, and cast them into the Red-ſea.</hi>] That which we call the <hi>Red-ſea,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews call the Sea of <hi>Suph,</hi> i. e. of Flags; as we tranſlate the word <hi>Suph,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 3. becauſe it was full of a certain Weed (which the Latines call <hi>alga,</hi> and the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) which ſome Travellers have affirmed to be of a red Colour, and to make the Water appear as if it were red alſo: from whence ſome fancy it was called the <hi>Red-ſea.</hi> Certain it is, it had the Hebrew Name of <hi>Suph</hi> from hence; there being ſuch abundance of this Weed in that Sea, that the Inhabitants of the Coaſt, plucking it up out of the Water, and laying it in heaps to be dried by the Sun, it becomes ſo compact, that they build Houſes of it, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his <hi>Phaleg.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60246:90"/>to have had the Name of the <hi>Red-ſea</hi> from this: that what the Hebrews called the <hi>Sea of Suph,</hi> the nearer Neighbours called the <hi>Sea of Edom,</hi> from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which it waſhed, <hi>viz. Idumaea,</hi> 1 Kings IX. 26. XXI <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. From whence, the Greeks, who knew not the reaſon of the Name, called it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>Red-ſea;</hi> becauſe <hi>Edom,</hi> in Hebrew, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies red, as we find XXV <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. Now this Sea (which late Writers call <hi>Sinus Arabicus</hi>) lies Eaſt of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and therefore a Weſt wind was moſt proper to drive the Locuſts thither.</p>

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And there was thick Darkneſs in all the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>three days.</hi>] Some think, that during this <hi>three days</hi> Darkneſs the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Circumciſed; when the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by reaſon of the great Horrour they were in all that time, could take no Advantage of them. And ſo Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> expounds CV <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. <hi>They rebelled not against his word;</hi> but ſubmitted to be Circumciſed. For the words ſeem to ſignifie ſome ſpecial piece of Obedience, which they then performed. The Author of <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes, will have it, that they puniſhed and cut off ſeveral wicked People among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves; which they did at this time, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> might not know it, and rejoyce at it. But that which is more certain, is, that if the former Plague ended on the <hi>ninth</hi> day, this Judgment was ordered upon the <hi>tenth</hi> of the Month <hi>Abib.</hi> On which day they begun to prepare for the Paſſover, by taking up the Lamb which was to be then ſlain <hi>four</hi> days after.

               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>They ſaw not one another.</hi> We may well look upon this, as an Emblem of the Blindneſs of their Minds; which was ſo great, that they had not the leaſt diſcerning of their approaching Deſtruction. Some of the <hi>Romans</hi> mention ſuch Darkneſs for a ſhort time, as was counted prodigious, by <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Julius Obſequens.</hi> Particularly at the Death of the Emperour <hi>Carus,</hi> there was ſuch a Miſt, that <hi>one man could not know another,</hi> (See more Examples in <hi>Hue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, L.</hi> II. <hi>Alnet.

Which no Man hath the leaſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60246:91"/>reaſon to disbelieve; it being as eaſie for God to continue it for three days, as for one hour; there being alſo a very great reaſon for it, both to puniſh the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and relieve the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

And the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> juſtifies him, in part, when inſtead of mentioning this Plague of Darkneſs (as he doth the reſt which were inflicted on the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>) he ſaith, God <hi>ſent evil Angels among them,</hi> LXXVIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.</p>

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>called unto</hi> Moſes.] He was ſo terrified by the horrible Apparitions he had ſeen, that at the end of the <hi>three</hi> days of Darkneſs, he ſent a Meſſenger to call <hi>Moſes:</hi> for before that time none could find their way to him. Or perhaps, the meaning may be, that in his ravening ſit, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if he had been near him.</p>

But this was the effect of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, which was incurable; and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to part with them, but ſtill to keep a Pawn for their Return to his Servitude.</p>

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaid unto him, Get thee from me.</hi>] This ſounds, as if he intended again to have him driven from his Preſence, (as <hi>v.</hi> 11.) ſo ſoon did he forget his own humble Confeſſions and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. and returned to his frantick Rage and Fury againſt him.</p>

There is nothing more agreeable to the Rules of Juſtice, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict heavy Judgments upon contumacious Offenders; and no Puniſhment heavier than to let them undo themſelves by their own Wickedneſs, and blindly run on, without any ſtop, in their evil Courſes unto utter Ruin.

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>In the Tenth day of this Month.</hi>] This is a Law which hath reſpect to all future Ages, as well as to this preſent Time; that they ſhould begin to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> four days before: For which the Jews give ſuch Reaſons as theſe: <hi>viz.</hi> It was neceſſary when they went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to make this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt a multitude of Buſineſs, when they were preſſed to be gone in haſte, ſhould have made them neglect it. And it was neceſſary afterwards, that they might more narrowly obſerve, if there were any Blemiſh in the Lamb; and that they might be put in mind to diſpoſe themſelves for ſo great a Solemnity.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable that our Bleſſed Saviour (the true Paſchal Lamb) came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on this very day (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>Niſan</hi>) <hi>four</hi> days before he was offered, XII <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 12. Yet there are thoſe who think, that this Precept was peculiar to this Time of their Departure out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For they that came, in after Ages, out of all parts of the Country to worſhip God at this Feaſt, could not ſo well obſerve it; unleſs we ſuppoſe them to have come ſome days before to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as its certain ſome did, XI <hi>Joh.</hi> 55.) or to have ſent before hand thither, to have a Lamb prepared for them, which is not unlikely.</p>
               <p>They alſo, who think the <hi>Egyptians</hi> now worſhipped ſuch kind of Creatures, imagine withal, that this day was choſen in oppoſition to them: who, becauſe the Sun entred then into <hi>Aries,</hi> began on this day the Solemn Worſhip of this Creature, and of that Celeſtial Sign. Thus the Author of the <hi>Chronicon Orientale,</hi> in expreſs words: <hi>This was the day in which the Sun entred the first Sign of</hi> Aries, <hi>and was most Solemn among the</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60246:97"/>Egyptians. And therefore God commanded the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to Sacrifice that Creature which they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. But there is no certainty of this, nor of what the Author of <hi>Tzeror Hamor</hi> obſerves, that the Feaſt of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being at its heighth on the <hi>fourteenth</hi> day, God ordered the killing of this Lamb at that time: which was the greateſt contempt of their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niger Ammon</hi> (whom they worſhipped then with the greateſt Honours) ſhowing he could be no God, whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall take to them every Man a Lamb.</hi>] The word <hi>Seh</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Kid</hi> as well as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> XV <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. XIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and it is evident, from the <hi>fifth</hi> Verſe of this Chapter, that they might take either of them for this Sacrifice. But commonly they made choice of a Lamb, as the fitteſt of the two; being of a more mild and innocent Nature. They that are of opinion, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> now worſhipped ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, imagine alſo this was ordained to preſerve the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their Idolatry, by commanding them to kill ſuch Beaſts as they adored. So <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom,</hi> God intended by this, <hi>to expel out of the Minds of the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>the evil opinion of the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Lamb for an Houſe.</hi>] Some tranſlate it <hi>for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi> But that is not true: For as <hi>Tribes</hi> were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Families,</hi> ſo were <hi>Families</hi> into <hi>Houſes:</hi> and when many Lambs were few enow for a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſome Houſes were ſo ſmall that they could not eat one, and therefore were to call in the aſſiſtance of their Neighbours, as it follows in the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And if the houſhold be too little for the Lamb, let him and his Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c.] They were not to be fewer than <hi>Ten</hi> Perſons, nor more than <hi>Twenty,</hi> to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60246:97"/>the eating of one Lamb. At which meal, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, Maſters and Servants (if Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed) were entertained, and every one did eat a piece, at leaſt as big as an Olive, if we may believe the Hebrew Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man, according to his eating, ſhall make your count for the Lamb.</hi>] That is, every Maſter of a Houſe, ſhall take ſuch a number of Perſons to him, as will be ſufficient for the eating of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>The Lamb ſhall be without blemiſh.</hi>] In the Hebrew, <hi>perfect,</hi> or without defect. There are <hi>ten</hi> Blemiſhes mentioned in XXII <hi>Levit.</hi> 22, 23, 24. which made a Sacrifice unfit for the Altar. About which the Heathen themſelves were very curious, as I noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove out of <hi>Herodotus:</hi> who relates how exact and ſcrupulous the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts were in their Scrutiny, whether a Beaſt were fit to be offered. See VIII. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Male.</hi>] Becauſe the Male was counted more excellent than the Female, I <hi>Malachi</hi> 14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all whole Burnt-offerings (which were the moſt perfect ſort of Sacrifices) were to be <hi>Males</hi> only, I <hi>Lev.</hi> 3, 6. From hence this Cuſtom (as <hi>Bochart</hi> thinks) was derived to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> who offered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Males, as he proves out of <hi>Herodotus, P.</hi> I. <hi>Hieroz. L.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 33, 50. But whatſoever the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, the <hi>Romans</hi> did otherwiſe. For <hi>Servius</hi> ſaith (in VIII <hi>Aeneid.</hi>) <hi>In omnibus Sacris faeminini generis plus valent victimae;</hi> that Sacrifices of the Female kind, were of greateſt value in all their Holy Offices. Such different fancies there were in the World in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but what Opinions they had in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, none can certainly reſolve.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:60246:98"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the first year.</hi>] It doth not ſignifie that the Lamb was to be a year old (for then it was uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be offered) but under a year old. It was fit for Sacrifice at <hi>eight</hi> days old, though not before, XXII 30. XXII <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. (which Laws, <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith, were obſerved in the Paſchal Lamb, as they were in the Daily Sacrifice, XXIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. XXXVIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. and in others, XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 18, 19.) and ſo it continued ſit from that time, till it was a year old: after which it was not accepted. For which <hi>Bochart</hi> gives a very likely reaſon in the fore-named Book, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 50. <hi>p.</hi> 585.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And ye ſhall keep it until the fourteenth day of the ſame Month.</hi>] When it was to be offered to God by all the People, as our Saviour was upon the very ſame day. Which the Jews expected, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a memorable paſſage which <hi>Andr. Maſius</hi> (in V <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.) quotes out of that Tract in the <hi>Talmud</hi> called <hi>Roſch Haſhanah,</hi> where they ſay it was a <hi>famous and old opinion among the ancient Jews, that the day of the New Year, which was the beginning of the</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>deliverance out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſhould in future time be the beginning of their Redemption by the Meſſiah.</hi> Which was wonderfully fulfilled in our Lord and Saviour; who keeping the Paſſover the day before the Rulers of the Jews obſerved it, it fell out that he, the true Lamb of God, was offered on that very day, which <hi>Moſes</hi> here appointed for the Offering this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the whole Aſſembly of the Congregation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall kill it.</hi>] God here grants a Liberty to any Man among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to kill the Paſſover. Which act did not make him a Prieſt (whoſe work it was to offer the Blood) for in other Sacrifices any Man that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60246:98"/>brought them might do the ſame, I <hi>Lev.</hi> 3, 4, 5. And this is given as a reaſon, why the People did not kill the Paſſover in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, becauſe they were unclean; and therefore the <hi>Levites</hi> had the charge of it, II <hi>Chron.</hi> XXX. 17.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to mean, that all the Company who were to eat, were to be preſent at the Sacrifice: By which means, <hi>the whole Aſſembly of the Congregation of Iſrael</hi> were engaged in this Service. And this was exactly alſo fulfilled in our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>our Paſſover</hi>) againſt whom the Prieſts, and Scribes, and Phariſees, and all the People, conſpired to take away his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Evening.</hi>] In the Hebrew the words are (as is noted in the Margin of our Bibles) <hi>between the two Evenings.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of which began, when the Sun began to decline from its Noon-tide point, and laſted till Sun ſet. Then began the <hi>ſecond</hi> Evening, and laſted till Night. Between theſe <hi>two Evenings,</hi> about the middle of them, was the Paſſover offered. For after the offering of Incenſe, they began on this day to kill the daily Evening Sacrifice, between two and three in the Afternoon (a little ſooner than on other days) and having ſiniſhed that, and trimmed the Lamps (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Treatiſe on this Subject, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. deſcribes the order of it) they went about the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Sacrifice; which continued till Sun-ſetting. That is, there were about two hours and an half, for the diſpatch of all the Lambs. For the daily Evening Sacrifice, and all belonging to it, being over in an hours time (by half an hour after three) all the reſt of the day till Sun-ſet (which was two hours and an half at this time of the Year) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for the killing of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lambs.

Both theſe were ſprinkled with the Blood, but not the Threſhold, leſt any Body ſhould tread upon it, which had been prophane, this being an holy thing. This ſtriking or ſprinkling of the Blood upon the Poſts, ſeems to have been peculiar to the firſt <hi>Paſſover,</hi> at their going out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and not to have been uſed in after Times: when there was not the ſame occaſion for it, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſtinguiſh their Houſes from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for their preſervation from the deſtroying Angel.</p>

But the Hebrew word <hi>baſhal</hi> ſignifying to <hi>rost,</hi> as well as to <hi>boil,</hi> according as the matter is, <hi>Moſes</hi> takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that ambiguity, by adding <hi>with water:</hi> and alſo by expreſly naming the oppoſite to it, <hi>but roſt with fire.</hi> Which was ordained in oppoſition to ſome Gentile Cuſtoms in the Eaſtern Countries (if they were ſo ancient as the times of <hi>Moſes</hi>) where they boiled the Fleſh of their Sacrifices, when they prayed to their Gods againſt Drought, by the ſcorching Heat of the Sun.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rost with fire.</hi>] Contrary to the manner in all other <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> whoſe Fleſh, that was allowed to be eaten, either by Prieſt or People, was to be ſodden; even in the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover:</hi> as we read
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60246:100"/>expreſly 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXV. 13. where theſe things are accurately diſtinguiſhed. And <hi>Maimonides</hi> gives this as the reaſon of it (why they are commanded to <hi>eat it roſted</hi>) becauſe they went out in great haſte, and had not time to Boil it, <hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nev. c.</hi> 46. Some of the Gentiles in after-times <hi>roſted</hi> their Meat in the Sun, as <hi>Heliodorus</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Aethiopic.</hi> And ſome Grecian Women (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us) did the ſame in their Feaſt called <gap reason="foreign">

(only there is an Exception in the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, 16, 17. for Sacrifices that were a <hi>Vow,</hi> or a <hi>voluntary Offering</hi>) by which God provided that Holy Things ſhould not be in danger to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or put to prophane Uſes; and that they might not loſe their juſt Eſtimation: as even common Meat doth, which is not ſo much valued, when it is kept till the next day; for Men deſire that which is freſh and newly dreſſed.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Paſchal</hi> Sacrifice alſo, it was the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it ſhould not remain, leſt they ſhould have been forced, either to carry it away with them, which might have been troubleſome; or if they left it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

Beſides, there might have been danger alſo of turning ſuch Reliques to Superſtitious Uſes, as the brazen Serpent was: God working as great a Deliverance by the one, as by the other. And this we may the rather think, becauſe it is certain the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Idolaters were wont to ſave ſome part of their Sacrifices for Superſtitious Purpoſes, as appears from VI <hi>Baruch</hi> 27. <hi>Herodotus</hi> teſtifies the ſame concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient <hi>Perſians, L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 132.

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Seven days ſhall ye eat unleavend Bread.</hi>] The ſeven days following the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> were obſerved as a diſtinct Feſtival, and called <hi>The Feast of unleavened Bread,</hi> v. 17. becauſe no Bread that had any leaven in it, might be eaten all that time. Which the Jews expound thus: Not that they were bound to eat unleavened Bread all thoſe ſeven days (which was neceſſary only on that Night when the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was killed) but only not to eat
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60246:103"/>leavened Bread. That was utterly unlawful; but they might eat Rice, or parched Corn, or any ſuch thing. See <hi>Petavius in Epiphan. Haereſ.</hi> LXX. N. XI.</p>
               <p>At their march indeed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to eat unleavened Bread (having none elſe to eat) not only for <hi>ſeven days,</hi> but for a <hi>whole month:</hi> that is, from the <hi>fifteenth</hi> of the firſt Month, to the <hi>fifteenth</hi> and <hi>ſixteenth</hi> of the next; when God gave them <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> XVI. 1, 12, 13.

See <hi>Buxtorf. Synag. Jud. c.</hi> 19. where he ſhows at large what things might be done, and what not on theſe days, according to the Opinion of their Doctors.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And ye ſhall obſerve the Feast of unleavened Bread,</hi> &amp;c.] He repeats it again; becauſe it was a thing of great moment, to have theſe <hi>ſeven</hi> days ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved intirely, and not only the <hi>Paſſover</hi> upon the <hi>fourteenth</hi> day in the Evening: that they might eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year think ſo long of God's great Goodneſs, in delivering them from their miſerable Condition in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as not to let the ſenſe of ſo ſingular a Benefit ſlip at any time quite out of their Minds.</p>

Accordingly the Jews tell us, of an exact Search which every one was bound to make, with lighted Wax-Candles, leſt it ſhould remain in any Corner or Creviſe of the Houſe.

Accordingly, on the day before the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> they were very buſie in making Cakes, which they call <hi>Mazzoth,</hi> without any Butter, or Oyl, or ſo much as Salt in them; of meer Water and Flowre. Which being very inſipid, ſome made bold (as their Authors tells us) to add Eggs and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; and ſometimes the Richer ſort made them of meer Almonds; both for the honour of the Feaſt (as they pretended) and for the comfort of ſick and infirm People, as well as to render them more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60246:105"/>Yet on the firſt day of the Feaſt, they would eat none of theſe, but only the <hi>Bread of Affliction,</hi> (as they called it) made meerly of Meal and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

So <hi>Jacobus Capellus ad A.M.</hi> 2503.

Unto which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought it ſufficient to ſay, That they found it Recorded in their own Books; mentioning this place.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60246:113"/>eſpecially in any order. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath well reſolved this; That <hi>Moſes,</hi> having notice of God's Intentions ſome days before, (See <hi>v.</hi> 1.) had diſpoſed them for their Departure, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>This is the Ordinance of the Paſſover.</hi>] A further Rule to be obſerved at this Feaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There ſhall no Stranger eat thereof.</hi>] Several of the Jewiſh Doctors, by <hi>the Son of a Stranger,</hi> underſtand an Apoſtate from the Religion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſtrange Worſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> Idolatry; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 479. But it is not to be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, as appears from the next Verſe: which is a further Explication of this. Wherein he ordains, that no Man who did not embrace their Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhould eat of the Paſſover, though he was a Proſelyte ſo far, as to be permitted to live among them. For this being a Commemoration of the great Deliverance beſtowed upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> none but they were to partake of it; unleſs they would be Circumciſed, and thereby come into the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Which gave them a title to all the Priviledges of his Children; and obliged them, as well as the Natural <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to give Publick Thanks for this Work of their Redemption from Egyptian Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; to Worſhip and Serve their God according as he directed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 44. <hi>And every Man-ſervant that is bought for money.</hi>] As many were in thoſe Times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; who became their Maſters proper Goods, as much as their Cattle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When thou hast Circumciſed him, then ſhall he eat thereof.</hi>] He was not to be Circumciſed againſt his Will: but if he refuſed, after a years trial (as <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> expounds it) to receive Circumciſion, his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60246:114"/>Maſter was to ſell him again. For it is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think, that he was to be compelled to be Circumciſed, as thoſe Hebrew Doctors ſeem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, who ſay, <hi>That both Maſter and Servant were forbid to eat of it, till the Servant was Circumciſed.</hi> See <hi>Selden, L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 1.

               <p>Ver. 45. <hi>A Foreigner.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Toſchab</hi> literally ſignifies a <hi>Dweller</hi> or <hi>Inhabitant:</hi> by which Name thoſe pious Gentiles were called who renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Idolatry, though they did not embrace the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion; becauſe they were permitted to ſettle among them, and dwell in their Country, which was not allowed to other Foreigners, who continued Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.

               <p>Ver. 46. <hi>In one Houſe ſhall it be eaten,</hi> &amp;c.] In the firſt Night wherein this Sacrifice was ſlain, they were enjoyned not to ſtir out of Doors, <hi>v.</hi> 22. and therefore not to <hi>carry forth ought of the Fleſh abroad</hi> into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe. Beſides, they were in ſuch haſte, that they had no time to ſend Meſſengers from one Houſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60246:114"/>to another; which <hi>Maimonides</hi> makes the ground of this Precept, <hi>More Nev. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 46.

Which the ancient Fathers looked upon, as a Figure of the Unity of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the moſt natural Interpretation, that it ſhould be eaten under one Roof. But <hi>R.

And indeed, being eaten in haſte, they could not have time to break the Bones, and ſuck out the Marrow: which in the place before-named (in his <hi>More Nevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi>) he makes the Foundation of this Precept: Which was exactly fulfilled in the true Paſchal Lamb, of which this was a Figure, when he was offered for us, as St. <hi>John</hi> obſerves, XIX. 33, 36.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>No uncircumciſed Perſon ſhall eat thereof.</hi>] Which is the reaſon, ſome have thought, why they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Paſſover, as far as we can ſind, after that in the very next year that followed their coming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> becauſe they were generally Uncircumciſed. But this ſeems to relate to Men of another Nation; who though they were not admitted to eat of the Lamb, unleſs they received Circumciſion; yet having renounced Idolatry, the Jews ſay they might eat of the unleavened Bread, and of the bitter Herbs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 49. <hi>One Law ſhall be to him that is home-born,</hi> &amp;c.] Nothing could be more equal than this, that no Man ſhould enjoy this Priviledge, who was not of their Religion: but whoſoever embraced it ſhould partake of the ſame Benefits.</p>
               <p>Ver. 50. <hi>Thus did all the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] They kept this Paſſover; and afterwards another, by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial direction IX <hi>Numb.</hi> but afterward, during their ſtay in the Wilderneſs, they ſeem to have omitted it; becauſe they omitted Circumciſion, without which (<hi>v.</hi> 48.) they were not capable to partake of it.</p>

                  <hi>As the LORD commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſo did they.</hi>] Obſerved it according to all the Rites here enjoyned: though in future Ages ſeveral of them were omitted, as peculiar to this time.</p>
               <p>Ver. 51. <hi>And it came to paſs the ſelf ſame day,</hi> &amp;c.] On the day after they celebrated the Paſſover, they began their March out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which was a thing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60246:115"/>ſo notorious, that the memory of it was preſerved in Nations far diſtant from them: though the Story was much corrupted, for want of the Knowledge of theſe Sacred Records.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) followed him. For he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and taught that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had not right Conceptions, who likened God to wild Beaſts and Cattle: nor did the <hi>Aſricans</hi> or <hi>Greeks</hi> conceive of him better, who repreſented him like to Men: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>For there is but this one only God, that which comprehends us all, and the Earth and the Sea, which we call Heaven, and the World,</hi> &amp;c. In which words, he makes <hi>Moſes</hi> not ſo fooliſh as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and other Nations, but attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes a ſenſleſs Opinion to him, (that the World, which we ſee, is God) if this be the right reading of his words.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60246:117"/>that the whole World was his; and that Men had nothing in it, but by his gracious Grant: who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the Firſt-born of every thing to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all was his.

This the Jewiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors make one of the DCXIII.

It is no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> that from this Law of redeeming Aſſes, the Gentiles took up a fancy, which was common among them, that the Jews worſhipped an Aſſes Head.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60246:120"/>not acceptable to God. For though he once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his Son, yet it was not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done; and here he declares he did not approve of ſuch Sacrifices, by commanding them not to offer their Firſt-born to him, as they did the Firſtlings of clean Beaſts; but to redeem them. For the way of the Gentile World, even in thoſe days, was to offer their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> as appears from XX <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. where he orders him to be put to death, who <hi>gives any of his Seed to</hi> Moloch. The very ſame Phraſe which is uſed (as I obſerved <hi>v.</hi> 12.) concerning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing the Firſtlings of their Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the XVIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. he uſes both Phraſes, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not give any of thy Seed to paſs through to</hi> Moloch, <hi>or to paſs over to</hi> Moloch. The very ſame word, which we here tranſlate <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>ſet apart.</hi> And it was but neceſſary to give ſuch Precepts; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe Prohibitions, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell into this barbarous way of Worſhip, as we read CVI <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37, 38.</p>
               <p>Now this Redemption of their Firſt-born, was not long after ordered by God himſelf; who took the <hi>Levites</hi> inſtead of them, (as we read <hi>Numb.</hi> III.) where a certain Sum of Money was paid for all the reſt of the Firſt-born, that were above the number of the <hi>Levites.</hi> Which Sum, they who were born after that time, paid to the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Nor was this a thing unknown to the Gentiles.

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And it ſhall be for a token upon thine hand.</hi>] By this means there was a perpetual remembrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, of God's gracious Deliverance of them, when the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain. For nothing elſe can be meant by theſe words, but that they ſhould indeavour by Conſecrating their Firſt-born, to keep that Divine Benefit in mind as carefully, as if they had put a Sign upon their Hand, or bound it upon
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60246:121"/>their Forehead before their Eyes, to help their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. For it is a plain alluſion to thoſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frail Memories, are wont to tie a Thrid, or ſome ſuch thing upon their Finger, that they may not forget what they deſire to remember: That which is upon their Hand, being continually in view, and ſo not eaſily forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for frontlets between thine eyes.</hi>] Whatſoever be the Original of the Hebrew word <hi>Totaphot,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Frontlets,</hi> it is certain it ſignifies no more than <hi>Zicaron</hi> in the <hi>ninth</hi> Verſe: a <hi>Memorial,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,</hi> as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> tranſlates it. And ſo <hi>Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> expounds it, <hi>kenu Zicaron,</hi> as it were a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and that <hi>immoveable,</hi> as the LXX. take it. Yet from hence the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> have extracted their <hi>Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries</hi> (or pieces of Parchment, wherein this and other Texts were written) which they fancied were a kind of <hi>Amulets</hi> to defend them from dangers. For ſo they are ſaid to be in the <hi>Gemara Schabath:</hi> and therefore uſed in their Prayers, to drive away Evil Spirits, as <hi>J. Braunius,</hi> and many others have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I ſhall only note further, that this word is found but <hi>three</hi> times in the Law, and yet the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> tranſlates it three ſeveral ways; which ſhows how little the Original of it is underſtood, though the Senſe of it is plain and certain. See <hi>Petitus</hi> his <hi>Var. Lectiones, c.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For by ſtrength of hand the LORD brought us out of</hi> Egypt.] This hath been often mentioned in this very Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 3, 9, 14.) and now here repeated again, to make them very ſenſible; both that they owed their Deliverance intirely to God, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was too hard for him to accompliſh.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>God led them not through the way of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60246:122"/>Land of the Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.] That was the neareſt way from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> by the Mediterranean, to the River of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as the Scripture calls it) and ſo to <hi>Azotus</hi> and <hi>Gaza:</hi> which was a Journey of not above <hi>three</hi> days, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſays; others ſay of <hi>ten.</hi> But certainly it was no great way, for the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> went it often to and fro, XLII, XLIII, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt peradventure the People repent when they ſee war,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Philistines</hi> being a very warlike People, would, in all likelyhood, have oppoſed their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and God knew the temper of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be ſo timorous, that they would run away, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return to <hi>Egypt</hi> than ſight their way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> For all People grow cowardly by being kept long in ſlavery; which breaks their Spirits, and ſinks them as low as their Condition. They fought indeed about forty days after this with <hi>Amalek;</hi> but it was only one Battle; and then they were provided with Arms (which they had not now) from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom they found dead on the Sea-ſhore. But their baſe temper appeared too plainly the next year, when they heard the Report of the Spies concerning the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan:</hi> which put the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation into a fit of Deſpair, and made them think of returning to <hi>Egypt,</hi> XIV <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>But God led the People about.</hi>] The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Cloud mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 21. in which the LORD was, conducted them in a way further about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Through the way of the Wilderneſs.</hi>] He led them to the right hand toward the Red-ſea, and the Deſert of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>went up harneſſed.</hi>] Or in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60246:122"/>Military order: for though it is not likely the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> ſuffered them to have any Arms, yet, they did not go away tumultuouſly, like Fugitives; but marcht like Soldiers in good order; and, as in our <hi>Margin</hi> it is tranſlated, <hi>five in a Rank.</hi> Which is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Theodotion</hi> anciently, and of <hi>Montanus</hi> and others lately.

Which is far more likely, than the Story which the Author of <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes tells, that he carried <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Coffin out of <hi>Egypt</hi> upon his own ſhoulders: it being more probable that ſome of that Tribe undertook the care of it.

               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And the LORD went before them.</hi>] By the LORD we are here to underſtand the SCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINAH, or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> which appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, III. 2. when he gave him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to bring his People out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him all along in his Embaſſy to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Treaty with him, VI. 1, &amp;c. and now appeared in a glorious Cloud to conduct them, and aſſure them that he would take care of them. For this Cloud was a <hi>Symbal</hi> of his gracious Preſence with them, and ſpecial Providence over them. It being an <hi>Emanation</hi> from him (ſaith <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom</hi>) which was a <hi>Sign</hi> (as others of the Jews ſpeak) that God was Night and Day with them, to keep them from all evil. To which the Prophets allude, LII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. II <hi>Micah</hi> 13. And though his going before them, be not mentioned before this time, yet it is moſt likely he appeared in this Cloud, as their Conductor from their firſt coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and led them to <hi>Succoth,</hi> and then to <hi>Ethan;</hi> as he did afterward to their ſeveral Stations, X <hi>Numb.</hi> 11, 12, &amp;c. Which doth not ſignifie that God himſelf moved from place to place (for he is always every where) but this Cloud was moved by him from whom
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60246:124"/>it came, as a Token that he was preſent, by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour, Care and Providence, whereſoever it went.</p>

For ſo we are informed X <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. XIV. 14. CV <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> X. 1. And I can ſee no reaſon to think theſe were different Clouds, ſince one and the ſame would ſerve for both purpoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And by night in a pillar of Fire.</hi>] The ſame Pillar appeared in the Night like Fire, which in the Day was like a Cloud. The reaſon of which follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To give them light.</hi>] That they might be able (as the next words tell us) to travel by Night, as well as by Day. Which made the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſay, he went before them <hi>all the night, with the light of fire,</hi> LXXVIII. 14. This flaming Light I take to have been a glorious appearance of Angels from the SCHECHINAH; for they always attend upon the Divine Majeſty, <hi>who maketh his Angels Spirits, his Miniſters a flaming fire,</hi> CIV Pſalm 4. Some fancy there were two diſtinct Pillars, as theſe words, and the next Verſe ſeem to import: but it is plain by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, it was but one and the ſame Pillar, which had theſe different Appearances. See the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, XIV. 19, 24. I <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. Therefore <hi>Salvian</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribes it <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Gubern. Dei,</hi> where he calls it, <hi>Mobilem columnam nubilam die, igneam nocte, congruas colorum diverſitates pro temporum diverſitate ſumentem;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60246:124"/>ſc. ut &amp; diei lucem lutea obſcuritate diſtingueret, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginem noctis flammeo ſplendore claritatis radiaret.</hi> And ſee <hi>Greg. Nyſſen de Vita Moſis, p.</hi> 175.</p>
               <p>Now that the SCHECHINAH, or, <hi>the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> was in this Cloud, appears from hence; that it was the ſame Cloud which afterwards reſted upon the Tabernacle, as ſoon as it was ſet up, and is called <hi>the Cloud of the LORD,</hi> XL <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. X <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. For <hi>the Glory of the LORD</hi> was within the Tabernacle, as the Cloud was without it, XL <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 34, 35, &amp;c. And it is there alſo deſcribed juſt as it is here, that it appeared as a Cloud upon the Tabernacle by Day, and as a Fire by Night, XL. <hi>ult.</hi> And ſo it is alſo IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>At Even there was upon the Tabernacle, as it were the appearance of Fire till the Morning. So it was alway, the Cloud covered it by Day, and the appearance of Fire by Night.</hi> And then it conducted them in their Journeys, as it did now, XL <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 17, 18, &amp;c. Which ſhows that this Cloud, which now conducted them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was the very ſame with that which afterwards ſetled upon the Tabernacle: And the <hi>Glory of the LORD</hi> being in that, I make no doubt it was ſo in this. Which is the reaſon that the LORD is ſaid to <hi>go before them,</hi> and to <hi>lead</hi> them by this Cloud. For though the LORD of all doth not <hi>go</hi> from place to place, yet this viſible <hi>Glory,</hi> which repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as in a ſpecial manner preſent with them (and therefore called <hi>the Glory of the LORD</hi>) did go along with them in the Cloud, to their ſeveral Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whither they removed.</p>
               <p>It is no improbable Conjecture of <hi>Taubman,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> that from hence it was, that the <hi>Poets</hi> never make a Deity to appear but in a Cloud
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60246:125"/>with a brightneſs in it. <hi>Ad hoc exemplum credo Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ſanciviſſe nullum Numen mortalibus apparere ſine Nimbo. Est autem Nimbus, nubes divina, ſeu fluidum lumen, quod Deorum capita tingit.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>He took not away the pillar of the Cloud by day, and the pillar of Fire by night, from before the People.</hi>] That is, it continued with them as long as <hi>Moſes</hi> lived, till they came to paſs over <hi>Jordan</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi> when not this <hi>Cloud,</hi> but the <hi>Ark</hi> was their Guide. And it need not ſeem incredible, ſaith <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Stromat. p.</hi> 348.) that they were thus led by a Pillar of Fire, when the Greeks conſider that <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> they believe, was thus directed, <gap reason="foreign">

The wonder was, that this Fire continued to lead the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forty years in the Wilderneſs; whereas that of <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> (if it be true) was but a ſhort appearance. As that Light alſo was, which they ſay ſhone from Heaven to bring <hi>Timoleon</hi> unto his Port, when he ſailed to <hi>Italy.</hi>

For having lately felt ſuch an heavy ſtroke upon all the Firſt-born, as mollified his heart for the preſent, and moved him to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go; it was the higheſt degree of Infatuation not to fear (as formerly they had done, XII. 33.) that the next blow (if he purſued them) would be at himſelf and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>

For which reaſon he purſued them with Chariots and Horſmen, who could make larger mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on foot. The ſtrength alſo of this Kingdom conſiſted in Chariots, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men in them, who ſought out of them.

And ſo the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Book of Wiſdom</hi> juſtly cenſures it; XIX. 3. <hi>For whilst they were yet mourning and making Lamentations at the Graves of the Dead, they added another fooliſh device, and purſued them as Fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.</hi> Yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives good hints, that even this effect of Divine Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was but ſuch as hath ſeized upon worldly wiſe Princes, and States-men in former Ages, and may hereafter be inflicted upon more.</p>

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>But the</hi> Egyptians <hi>purſued after them.</hi>] This did not diſcourage <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants: who, perhaps, were of the ſame mind with the <hi>Syrians;</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:60246:128"/>who fancied the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not be alike pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in all places; but though he was ſtronger than their Gods in the Hills, yet they might be too hard for him in the Plain, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XX. 23.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60246:129"/>their Deliverer. From whence we may learn, the wicked temper of thoſe who are ungrateful and unmindful of Benefits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us out of</hi> Egypt?] They ſeem to have been of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame temper with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance what they had lately felt, nor made any reflections on what God had done in a wonderful manner among them. This neglect of God bred ſuch a hardneſs of heart in them and their Poſterity, as was in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People; which provoked God to harden them, in the ſame manner, to their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For, as the Apoſtle obſerves, God <hi>hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> IX Rom. 18.

                  <hi>And the pillar of the Cloud went from before their face,</hi> &amp;c.] This, it is evident, was done in the day time, before the night came: for the Cloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only in the day; in the night there was the appearance of Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſtood behind them.</hi>] To protect them from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were at their backs, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. but, by the intervention of this Cloud, quite loſt the ſight of them; as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>It may be noted here therefore once for all, that there were ſeveral uſes of this <hi>Cloud. First,</hi> to guide them in their Journeys. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prevent them from the heat of the Sun in the Wilderneſs; where there were few Trees, and no Houſes to ſhelter them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to defend them from their Enemies, that they might not aſſault them. And <hi>lastly,</hi> God from hence, when there was occaſion, ſpake with <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, it is plain, he appeared in this Cloud, XXXI <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. And from thence talked with <hi>Moſes,</hi> XXXIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 9, 10. And out of it called for <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> to come before him, XII <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And it came to paſs between the Camp of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and the Camp of</hi> Iſrael.] This was done, as I ſaid, in the day time: and in the next words <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, how it appeared in the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was a Cloud and Darkneſs to them.</hi>] i.e. To the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It was at the ſame time both a <hi>Cloud</hi> and a <hi>Fire:</hi> being dark on the one ſide, next to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> but bright and ſhining on the other ſide, next the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</hi> So that they might ſee their way, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> not ſee them, nor come near them (as it here follows) all the night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD cauſed the Sea to go back.</hi>] By this it is evident, that the SCHECHINAH, or Divine Majeſty, was preſent, and imployed his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel (<hi>v.</hi> 19.) in this work.

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And the Iſraelites went in to the midst of the Sea.</hi>] About the ſecond Watch of the Night (which was at Midnight) and about break of Day, they were got quite through.</p>

And the Waters of <hi>Scamander</hi> being ſwell'd to deſtroy <hi>Achilles,</hi> he makes to be dried up by <hi>Vulcan.</hi> As <hi>Nonnus</hi> alſo makes <hi>Bacchus</hi> drying up <hi>Hydaſpes;</hi> and ſmiting <hi>Orontes</hi> with his <hi>Thyrſus</hi> to have gone over it.

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Waters were a Wall unto them on the right hand, and on the left.</hi>] The ſtrong Eaſt-wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, no doubt, to the cutting of the Waters in two; though not without the help of Angelical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But I do not ſee, how it could do any thing to the compacting of the Waters to ſuch a degree, that they were no longer fluid, but firm as a Wall or Bank on each ſide of them, (See XV. 8.) which was effected wholly by the Angelical Miniſtry; who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Waters in that ſolid poſture, till the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were got quite out of the Sea.</p>
               <p>It hath been an old Queſtion, Whether they went quite croſs the Red-ſea, or only fetcht a compaſs, and came out upon the ſame Shore, from which they went in. The Hebrew Doctors are of opinion, that they did not go over to the oppoſite Shore: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a kind of <hi>Semi-circle,</hi> found themſelves, when they came out, in the ſame Country where they were before: Their reaſons are, becauſe they could not in ſo ſmall a time have marcht ſo far; for in the narroweſt place, that Gulf is XII. or XV. German Miles over; ſo that they could not all have paſſed through, in leſs than <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> days, as <hi>David Chytraeus</hi> makes the computation. But eſpecially, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60246:133"/>makes their next Station to be in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Etham,</hi> XXXIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. in which place they were the day before they came to the Sea, XIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Therefore they were ſtill in the ſame Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And the Egyptians purſued, and went in after them into the midst of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c.] Imagining perhaps they were ſtill upon the Land, or on the Shore where the Sea was retired; the darkneſs of the Night not ſuffering them to ſee the Mountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on each ſide: or rather, their Minds being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to overtake the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they regarded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: For when Men are ingaged in a fierce chaſe of any thing, with eager deſires and confident hopes of it, it takes up all their thoughts, and makes them overlook what lies before their eyes. Thus by their own violent Paſſions, and proud Imaginations, God blinded their Minds, and hardned their hearts (as he ſaid he would, <hi>v.</hi> 17.) to ruſh into their own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And it came to paſs that in the morning watch.</hi>] The <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> alſo, divided the Night into <hi>four</hi> parts, containing <hi>three</hi> hours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. At the beginning of which the Guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who kept watch by Night, was changed; and thence they were called <hi>Watches.</hi> Two of them we find mentioned by St. <hi>Luke</hi> XII. 38. and St. <hi>Mark</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them all, XIII. 35. and particularly the <hi>fourth</hi> Watch, VI <hi>Mark</hi> 48. called here the Morning Watch; which was the laſt of them: between Day-break and the Morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The LORD looked unto the Host of the Egyptians.</hi>] He frowned upon them; as we ſpeak now in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. For in Scripture, God is ſaid ſometimes <hi>to look, upon</hi> thoſe, whom he is about to puniſh,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60246:134"/>CIV <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. IX <hi>Amos</hi> 4. III <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Through the pillar of fire and the Cloud.</hi>] By this it is manifeſt there was but one Pillar, which had different Appearances: and that the SCHECHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAH, or Divine Majeſty was in it. It ſeems to me alſo very probable, that whereas the cloudy part of the Pillar had been towards the <hi>Egyptians</hi> hitherto; now it turned the other ſide toward them: and the ſiery part appearing, let them ſee the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were; and by its amazing brightneſs perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded them. So <hi>Philo</hi> ſeems to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, when he ſaith (<hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>de Vita Moſis</hi>) that <hi>from the Cloud that was in the Rear of the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>there ſhone a fiery Appearance of the Deity.</hi> Which may well be the meaning of the LORD's <hi>looking through the Pillar of Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And troubled the Host of the Egyptians.</hi>] This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Light, I ſuppoſe, flaſhing in their Faces, put them into a Conſternation. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> adds, in the concluſion of his <hi>Second Book of Antiquities,</hi> that there was a dreadful Storm or Tempeſt, with Thunder, Lightning and Hailſtones from the Cloud, which put them into the greateſt diſorder; as it follows in the next Verſe. Hither Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> refers thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> LXXVII. 17, 18. <hi>The Clouds poured out Water; the Skies ſent out a ſound: thine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows alſo went abroad. The Voice of thy Thunder was in the Heaven: the Lightnings lightned the World, the Earth trembled and ſhook,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And took off their Chariot wheels.</hi>] Some of their Wheels were broken by the Hail-ſtones, or burnt with Lightning: with which, its likely, their Horſes were ſo affrighted, that they fell into diſorder; and one Chariot running againſt another, ſome of their Wheels were taken off.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:60246:134"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they drave heavily.</hi>] They could ſcarce move, or but very ſlowly, when their Wheels were broken, or taken off: And thoſe Wheels that remained ſunk deep into the Sand, when the Waters returned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that the Egyptians ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] They cried one to another, Let us give over the purſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the LORD fighteth for them,</hi> &amp;c.] Now <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his words were made good, (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themſelves acknowledged it, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes.] He ſpake to him out of the Cloud, where the SCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINAH was; as I have often ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stretch out thy hand over the Sea, that the Waters may return again upon the Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.] God was pleaſed to uſe the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the drowning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as he had done in the Preſervation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Sea, (<hi>v.</hi> 16, 21.) that all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might honour and reverence him, and be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his direction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And the Sea returned to its ſtrength.</hi>] The ſenſe is truly expreſſed by the Vulgar, <hi>the Sea return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its former place.</hi> The great Walls, or heaps of Water which were on either ſide of them, falling down, and ruſhing upon them with a mighty force, overwhelmed them, and filled the whole Channel as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Morning appeared.</hi>] When it was light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Egyptians fled against it.</hi>] They were ſo frighted by the Light which ſhone in their Faces, and by the Thunder and Hail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they turned back; and, like Men diſtracted, run and met the Waters, which came tumbling down upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60246:135"/>midst of the Sea.</hi>] The Hebrew word imports throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down with violence and precipitation: and may be tranſlated, <hi>threw them headlong. Artapanus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> IX. <hi>Praepar.

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And the Waters returned and covered the Chariots,</hi> &amp;c.] The Sea returned to its former depth; ſo that they were ſwallowed up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the Host of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>that came into the Sea after them.</hi>] Some have fancied that all the Hoſt of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did not periſh; but only ſo many of them as purſued the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the Sea; which they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy this place intimates ſome did not. But the plain meaning is, that they all <hi>came into the Sea</hi> after the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and were all drowned in it. It is a wilder fancy, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alone was ſaved by the Angels, <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Gabriel;</hi> becauſe he cried out, as he had done heretofore, IX. 27. <hi>The LORD is righteous, and I and my People are wicked.</hi> Thus the Author of <hi>Dibre Hajamim</hi> (or <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Moſes) who ſays they tranſported him to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> where he reigned as long as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wandred in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. The ſame is related by other ſuch fabulous Writers, who are ſoberly confuted by <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> from the following words, <hi>There remained not ſo much as one of them:</hi> and from XV. 4, 19. where <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Song plainly makes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to have periſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt. And with him an old <hi>Midraſh</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> were drown'd, who had been the great Inſtruments of hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart. See our Learned <hi>J.

               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>But the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>walked on dry Land,</hi> &amp;c.] Or, <hi>Had walked:</hi> for it ſeems to be a meer fancy, that they were ſtill in the Sea, and had not paſſed quite through it, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt were drowned. For which there is no ground but this word <hi>walked;</hi> which may as well be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the time perfectly paſt, as in the preſent.

And now there was a very great reaſon for it; and for that triumphant Hymn which they ſung upon this Solemnity, Chap. XV. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> will have this Day to have been that which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward kept for their Sabbath, in memory of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Houſe of Bondage. This he gathers from the Repetition of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> in the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> where leaving out the reaſon for this Commandment, from the Creation of the World, <hi>Moſes</hi> inſerts this other of their Redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the ground of obſerving that <hi>Seventh</hi> day rather than any other, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Therefore the LORD commanded thee to keep the Sabbath;</hi> namely, not for the <hi>quotum</hi> of one day in ſeven (of that there was another reaſon, from the Example of God in the Creation) but for the <hi>deſignation</hi> of that day, after the preceding ſix

                  <hi>And</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaw the Egyptians dead upon the Sea-ſhore.</hi>] It may be interpreted, that, as they ſtood upon the Sea-ſhore, they ſaw their dead Bodies floating upon the Waters. But it is likely alſo, that by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, and by the Divine Providence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Bodies were caſt on ſhore, that the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> might have the benefit of the Spoil, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of their Arms, which they wanted, and were now by this overthrow furniſhed withal.</p>
               <p>This Shore was inhabited by the <hi>Icthyophagi,</hi> among whom the memory of this Receſs and Return of the Sea was preſerved, (as I obſerved upon <hi>v.</hi> 21.) and unto whom the dead Bodies were given for food, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, LXXIV. 14. that is, to the Beaſts and Birds of Prey, which peopled the neighbouring Wilderneſs. This was done by the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of the LORD God of the Hebrews:</hi> who made this proud Prince, his States-men and Army a Prey, not only to the Fiſhes and Sea-monſters; but a <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble booty</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> ſpeaks) to the promiſcuous ſorts of ravenous Creatures which inhabit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>

But I do not ſee how this can be made out; nor what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith concerning ſuch Songs, in many places. And after all the pains that <hi>Franc.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60246:137"/>and ſit to be ſung to Muſical Inſtruments; and ſo ſententious that they might be more eaſily remembred than ſimple Narrations: though now, after ſo many Ages, they cannot reduce this Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to Rules.</q> He tries indeed to bring this Song under certain Regulations; fancying that it conſiſts of eight Orders or Ranks, (as he calls them) <hi>two</hi> of which are very ſhort, and <hi>two</hi> very long; and <hi>four</hi> of a middle ſize: which he proſecutes with much Subtilty, but with little Satisfaction.</p>

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>It is he who hath given us this Victory, and therefore he is to be praiſed and acknowledged as our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. He is our most gracious and mighty God; for whom we will prepare a Tabernacle wherein to Worſhip him. Our Fathers had great Experience of his Goodneſs, and therefore we are the more bound to make him our most thankful Acknowledgments, and give him the highest Praiſes.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>It was a work of thy most excellent Power; which will be ever magnified in the overthrow of ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: With whom thou no ſooner ſhowedſt thy ſelf diſpleaſed, but they vaniſhed as ſtubble doth before the ſlame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Thou didst but give the Command, and by a vehement Wind the Waters of the Sea were divided and heaped up, ſo that they ſwelled into little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: and were campact like a Wall, which was upheld from falling down, till the People paſſed through the midſt of the Sea.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And why ſhould we doubt of our coming thither? The fame of this wonder ſhall go before us, and ſtrike a terrour into the most valiant Inhabitants of that Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Nay, all their Neighbours, as well as they, ſhall ſind their hearts fail them, and become as weak as Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Such a terrour ſhall fall upon them, that they ſhall be no more able to ſtir than a ſtone, when they hear of this dreadful Execution: but ſuffer thy People, O LORD, to paſs to their Inheritance, which thou hast prepared for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Thither ſhalt thou bring them, and there make them to take root in the higheſt Mountains of that Country: where thou hast deſigned a place for thine own Dwelling; of which thy Power alſo will lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>The Propheteſs.</hi>] She was called by this Name, I ſuppoſe, becauſe ſhe had a Gift of compoſing Hymns, in praiſe of the Divine Majeſty: which, it is certain, is meant ſometimes, by <hi>prophecying</hi> in Scripture. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> X. 5, 6. And thus among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and a <hi>Poet</hi> were the ſame thing: and the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Vates</hi> ſignifies both. For, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 10. Muſick was had in ſuch veneration in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, that <hi>iidem Muſici, &amp; Vates, &amp; Sapientes judicarentur.</hi> But there are other places of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which would incline one to think, that ſhe alſo received Revelations from God, for the direction of the People. Particularly VI <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. where ſhe is mentioned as one that conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and her own words, with <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, XII <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. <hi>hath not the LORD ſpoken by us alſo?</hi> Which the <hi>LORD heard,</hi> and doth not contradict; but rather allow to be true: though they had not ſuch near Communication with him as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

                  <hi>The Siſter of</hi> Aaron.] And why not of <hi>Moſes?</hi> The common Anſwer is, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and ſhe lived longeſt together; <hi>Moſes</hi> having been abſent from them XL. years. Or perhaps, <hi>Moſes</hi> was not by the ſame Mother, which <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> had. She was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Hur,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Joſephus.</hi>

                  <hi>Took a Timbrel in her hand.</hi>] So the manner was in after-times when they propheſied, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> X. 5, 6. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> III. 15. and when they ſang Hymns, XXXIII <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. LVII. 7, 8. and upon any occaſion of great rejoycing, XI <hi>Judg.</hi> 34. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XVIII. 6. From which we may learn, how ancient Muſick was in the Service of God: there being nothing in which it can be better imployed, than in his Praiſes. Therefore it was no part of the Gentile Idolatry, that they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch Inſtruments as theſe in their Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but they honoured falſe Gods in that manner, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had done the true. And it ought to have a remark ſet upon it, that this way of praiſing God was no part of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but derived from more ancient times, before the Law was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the Women went out after her.</hi>] To joyn with her in the Praiſes of God, as the Men did with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, with Timbrels and Dances.</hi> As they played with theſe Inſtruments in their hands, ſo their whole Bodies made a decent motion with their feet. Which afterwards tended to laſciviouſneſs, but anciently was very grave, and ſo becoming, that ſuch Dances were as devout Expreſſions of Joy, as their ſolemn Muſick. This appears by the Example of <hi>David,</hi> dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark, when it was brought up from the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> in a joyful Proceſſion both of Men and Women, with Vocal and Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XV. 27, 28, 29. LXVIII <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26. From which Patterns all Nations, from the moſt ancient Times, made Dancing a part of the Worſhip of their Gods; as <hi>Huetius</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Demonſtr. Evang.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60246:142"/>this Dancing of <hi>Miriam,</hi> and her Companions, on the Sea-ſhore, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> in his <hi>Hymn to Diana,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to her <gap reason="foreign">

And this was a way of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in after Times, as appears from the CXXXV <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and III <hi>Ezra</hi> 11. of which I have given ſome account in my Preface to the <hi>Paraphraſe of the Book of Pſalms.</hi> Which juſtiſies, or rather commends our way of Reading, or Chanting the <hi>Pſalms</hi> interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, by <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> as we call them, or <hi>Anſwering</hi> one to another: which certainly, it appears by this place, is the moſt ancient way of all other.

               <p>
                  <hi>They could not drink of the Water,</hi> &amp;c.] This was the more grievous, becauſe they had wanted this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment three days.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And the People murmured against</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, What ſhall we drink?</hi>] It is the conceit of <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> brought them from the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, without the direction of the Cloud, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them thither: but then left them to his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Which made the People think it was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Fault, that they were in this deſtreſs; who did not know how to lead them to the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and likely places, for the finding good Water. And therefore from <hi>Marah</hi> they ſtirred not, till the Cloud again led them; becauſe it is ſaid XVII. 1. they journied from <hi>Sin, by the Commandment of the LORD.</hi> But all this is a meer fancy, to excuſe his Foreſathers; who ſhould rather have prayed to God, than murmured againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> For we read expreſly, God <hi>did not take away the Pillar of the Cloud by day,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60246:143"/>and the Pillar of Fire by night, from before the People,</hi> XIII. 22. That is, it conſtantly guided them in the way wherein they ſhould go, whether they travelled by day or by night. And in that very place, which he builds his Opinion upon, where it is ſaid, they <hi>journied according to the commandment of the LORD;</hi> it is alſo expreſly recorded, that <hi>there was no water for the People to drink,</hi> XVII. 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And he cried unto the LORD.</hi>] He did what they ſhould have done; made his earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God to relieve them in this diſtreſs: which he inſtantly vouchſafed to do.</p>

                  <hi>And the LORD ſhowed him a Tree.</hi>] We are not told what Tree this was; whoſe Wood being thrown into the Waters, took off their bitterneſs: but, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Miracle, the Jews will have this to have been a Tree of bitter taſte, (which <hi>Jonathan</hi> calls <hi>Ardophne</hi>) which naturally would have made the Waters bitter, if they had been ſweet. <hi>Demetrius</hi> mentions this wonderful cure of the Waters, in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> his <hi>Praepar.

                  <hi>On the fifteenth day of the ſecond Month,</hi> &amp;c.] Juſt a Month after they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ſeems, they ſtayed a good while at <hi>Elim,</hi> where there was plenty of Water, and ſome ſhade; which was now very comfortable: this ſecond Month (which they call <hi>Ijar</hi>) anſwering to part of our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> Or otherwiſe, we muſt ſuppoſe they ſpent ſome time at the Red-ſea: whether God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them, perhaps, to put them in mind of his late great Mercy to them there; which might incline them to be more obedient to his Commands, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned XV. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the whole Congregation of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] Their Elders and all are included in theſe words, they being the ſame with thoſe <hi>v.</hi> 1. which certainly comprehend all that came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Though its likely, there were ſome more pious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who were not guilty of what follows; when the generality were ſo mutinous, that they who were better diſpoſed, could ſcarce be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Murmured against</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron.] This ſeems to be an higher diſcontent than the former, XV. 24. becauſe the <hi>whole Congregation</hi> were ingaged in it: whereas there it is only ſaid, <hi>the People</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. And there they quarrelled only with <hi>Moſes:</hi> but here with both their Leaders. And as that was for want of Water, ſo this for want of Bread: all their Dough which they brought out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> being now ſpent. So <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>R.

               <p>
                  <hi>For ye have brought us forth into this Wilderneſs.</hi>] They were glad to be brought out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but their Diſcontent aroſe from their being brought into a Wilderneſs; where they wanted all Proviſions, but what they brought along with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To kill this whole Congregation with hunger.</hi>] There was no danger of their periſhing preſently; they having ſo many Flocks to feed them. But without Bread this would not ſatisfie them; and they were loth, it is likely, to loſe any of their Stock, which they hoped rather to increaſe, than to diminiſh. Or elſe, they longed for Dainties, as they did afterwards: which moved God to ſend them great ſtore of Fowl; as we underſtand <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>

The Heathen themſelves preſerved ſome Memory of this, in that Fable of <hi>Pan</hi> (whom <hi>Huetius</hi> ſhows to be <hi>Moſes</hi>) finding out <hi>Ceres,</hi> when ſhe had been long wanting, to give Men bread when they were ready to ſtarve with hunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I may prove them.</hi>] Some think this relates to what goes before, concerning his ſending them Bread every day: which was ſo ordered, that he might prove, whether they would murmur, becauſe they had not enough at once for a whole year; or humbly hope in his Mercy, for a conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. But the following words [<hi>whether they will walk in my law, or no</hi>] direct us to a larger ſenſe; which is, that he tried whether they would be obedient to all his Commands, when he let them want nothing to ſupport and incourage them in his Service.</p>

Or, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it, that it might openly appear to the World, that God ſuſtains him, who follows his Worſhip and Service, by means that he did not think of.

               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be twice as much as they gather daily.</hi>] Enough, that is for two days, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>ſixth</hi> day, and the next, which was to be the Sabbath, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Where, what is here briefly ſaid in general, is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and largely explained.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Talmudists</hi> are generally of an opinion, that the XV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the ſecond Month, when they came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) was the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day of the week. See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> III. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 11. Which if
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60246:148"/>it be true, they knew nothing of the reſt of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> for they travelled upon this day. But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath obſerved, that it is altogether uncertain, whether or no, it was the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It might poſſibly fall out ſo, by the Providence of God, that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, deſigned by him for their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> might be both the <hi>ſeventh</hi> in order from the Creation, and alſo from the day of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But that which now determined this <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, after <hi>ſix</hi> days labour, to be their reſt, was their Redemption out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the Overwhelming of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt in the Red Sea: which was upon this very day. The Example of the Creation, was a reaſon for ſanctifying one day in <hi>ſeven:</hi> but the deſignation of this <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, was, as I ſaid, from their wonderful deliverance.

Therefore it may be better expounded, <hi>it is a Gift,</hi> or <hi>a Portion.</hi> For <hi>Manah</hi> ſignifies to appoint or order ones Diet, (I <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.) and as <hi>kav</hi> comes from <hi>kavah,</hi> by caſting away the laſt Letter; ſo may <hi>Man</hi> in like manner, from <hi>Manah.</hi> And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>This is the Gift of God,</hi> or, <hi>This is it which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60246:151"/>God hath appointed us:</hi> not knowing (as it here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) determinately what to call it. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſeems to have thought of this, when he defines it to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>For they wist not what it was.</hi>] Had not a diſtinct conception what kind of Food it was, not having yet taſted it; nor knowing certainly (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) whether this was the Bread that <hi>Moſes</hi> bad them expect: who there tells them, in the next words, that it was that Bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the Bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</hi>] You rightly called it <hi>a Divine Gift</hi> (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel</hi> goes on) for this indeed is the Bread which the LORD beſtows upon you for your Suſtenance, according to his Promiſe which he made you by me, <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.</hi>] Here now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhows how the uſe of this Food was to be regulated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gather of it every Man according to his eating.</hi>] As much as will ſuffice for his, and his Families Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Omer for every Man.</hi>] That they might be ſure to have enough, he allows every Perſon among them, to have an <hi>Omer:</hi> which was ſomething leſs, than half a Peck of our Meaſure. Here <hi>Abarbinel</hi> hath a pertinent obſervation; That this, being a Divine Food, was not to be uſed, as common things are, which Men gather into heaps; lay up in Barns, traffick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or lay up for their Children: but it was to be ſpent as a Gift of God both to Poor and Rich. Some can get more of worldly Goods, and ſome leſs; by which means ſome give, and others receive: But
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60246:151"/>here all received from the Bounty of Heaven; and God ordered it ſo, that they who were Poor ſhould not want; and they who were Rich ſhould have nothing beyond their wants, to lay up or to ſell, as they did other things. For every one was to have only as much as he could eat: and no Man could eat above an <hi>Omer.</hi> Which doth not ſignifie that they gathered it by meaſure; but as much as they thought would amount to that quantity: with an intention, that if they had more than they needed, others ſhould have it, who had gathered leſs than they needed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take ye every Man for them which are in his Tents.</hi>] For the old and the young, who could not go out to gather for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did ſo,</hi> &amp;c.] Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered what they thought would be ſufficient for themſelves and their Families: according as they were larger, or leſs in number. And when they came home they dealt to every one the proportion which God ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And gathered ſome more, ſome leſs.</hi>] They were not all alike able (it is like) to gather, nor alike diligent; and ſo did not gather an equal quantity. But the true reaſon, I have given already, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome Families did not require ſo much as others.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And when they did mete it with an Omer.</hi>] When it was brought unto their Tents, (<hi>v.</hi> 16.) then the Father of the Family, or ſome of the Rulers of the Congregation, (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) meaſured what they had gathered with an <hi>Omer;</hi> and gave to every one his proportion, according as God directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that gathered much, had nothing over.</hi>] Had no more than his <hi>Omer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:60246:152"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he that gathered little, had no lack.</hi>] He that had not gathered enough to make an <hi>Omer</hi> for every man, had it made up to him out of other Mens ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings, who had more than enough. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> will have it, that they were ſo directed by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Providence, as to gather juſt ſo much for their ſeveral Families, that every Perſon's ſhare would come to an <hi>Omer,</hi> and neither more nor leſs. And ſo <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> calls this the <hi>Second Miracle</hi> which was in the <hi>Manna,</hi> having obſerved one before, <hi>v.</hi> 14. But others think, that, if any part of it remained, after every one in the Family had an <hi>Omer,</hi> it was Food for their Cattle; which in the Wilderneſs wanted Graſs ſufficient for them. And this ſeems the more probable, becauſe otherwiſe we muſt make a new Miracle, that every Man, Woman, and Child, ſhould be able to eat an <hi>Omer:</hi> which all grant was ſufficient for the Suſtenance of any Man whatſoever; but was too much, ſure, for a Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They gathered every Man according to his eating.</hi>] As they were directed <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, Let no Man leave of it till the morning.</hi>] It was therefore to be all ſpent, one way or other, the ſame day it fell. Which was the Law of all the Holy Feaſts, particularly of the <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> XII. 10. and of the Sacrifice of <hi>Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> XXI <hi>Lev.</hi> 30. Beſides, God would have them depend upon his Providence, and truſt him for freſh Supplies every day; as <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> well notes. And <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom; He that kept it till the morning, betrayed his want of Faith, and feared God would ſend no more:</hi> for if he believed, to what purpoſe ſhould he be at the pains to keep it?</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:60246:152"/>
               <p>Here was a new Wonder, that as it fell every day for Forty years together, both in Winter and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and likewiſe fell in ſuch quantity, that every one had an <hi>Omer,</hi> and none wanted this Meaſure; ſo it would not keep till the next Morning; which it might have done in its own Nature, and did once in a Week; and in the Ark was preſerved to many Generations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Notwithſtanding they hearkned not unto</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>but ſome of them left of it till the morning.</hi>] Either through unbelief, or meer negligence, or a wanton inclination to make an Experiment, ſome among them diſobeyed his Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it bred Worms and ſtank.</hi>] This was a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo, that ſuch an heavenly Food, ſo pure and ſimple, ſhould not only breed Worms, but alſo ſtink. Which was a Puniſhment for their Diſobedience, though a merciful one, in that God did not inflict it upon themſelves, but upon their Food.</p>
               <p>The Jews commonly take theſe words to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; things being wont firſt to putrifie, and then to breed Worms: and in that order <hi>Moſes</hi> relates this matter, when it was laid up for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> v. 24. <hi>That it neither ſtank, neither was any Worm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> But <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks that <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks of it according to the order, wherein they found it: which was, that firſt Worms appeared in it to their Eyes, and then they ſmelt the ſtink. But in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what fell out on the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, he follows the natural order, and ſaith, it did not ſtink, neither was any Worm in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>was wroth with them.</hi>] Chid them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, for their Diſobedience to him, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſuch a ſingular benefit upon them.</p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:60246:153"/>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating.</hi>] This is not needleſly repeated; but a further Explication of their Care and Diligence, to furniſh themſelves early in the Morning, with as much as was neceſſary, before the Sun grew hot and melted it; or (as ſome of the Jews add) raiſed the Wind, which blew duſt upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Sun waxed hot, it melted.</hi>] That it might not be trod upon, nor putrified. Which ſeems to be ſpoken of that which remained in the open Field, ungathered: though <hi>Abarbinel</hi> will have it, that what they had brought into their Tents melted alſo when the Sun grew hot; which obliged them not only to gather it early, but to bake and prepare it preſently, while it was yet hard, and not diſſolved. But I ſee no ground for this; nor is it likely that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to prepare it all together; but might any time that day, at Supper as well as Dinner, order it according to their liking. Others of the Jews fancy that, being melted, it made little Brooks and Rivolets in the Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the plain ſence is, that the Sun which melted it, exhaled it alſo into the Air, from whence it came, and returned again the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>On the ſixth day they gathered twice as much Bread,</hi> &amp;c.] According to the Command of God, <hi>v.</hi> 5. It appears by this place, where it is called <hi>Bread</hi> (as it is <hi>v.</hi> 4, 12.) that it was of a hard Subſtance when it fell, though it diſſolved by the heat of the Sun; being like the Corn of which Bread is made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Rulers of the Congregation came and told</hi> Moſes.] He had bidden them gather a double quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity on the <hi>ſixth</hi> day; but had not told them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) and therefore they come now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60246:153"/>what they ſhould do with it. By this, one would think they were the Rulers, who ſaw a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution made to every one, in a juſt proportion: or, that they appointed Overſeers to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, this is that which the LORD hath ſaid.</hi>] This is the Command, which I have received from God about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To morrow is the rest.</hi>] Or <hi>ſhall be</hi> the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the holy Sabbath unto the LORD.</hi>] To be kept holy, ſo as to do no work therein. And therefore you muſt not ſo much as go into the field to gather your Food; which is the reaſon why you are ordered to make two days Proviſion, in one. The words in the Hebrew, (which we tranſlate <hi>the rest of the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto the LORD</hi>) may be rendred, as they lye in order, the <hi>Sabbath, the holy Sabbath unto the LORD.</hi> Which <hi>Abarbinel</hi> explains, as if the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated, ſignified, that it was to be a <hi>Ceſſation</hi> from all manner of Work, becauſe it was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the LORD himſelf, wherein he ceaſed from his Works.</p>
               <p>At this time, and not before, the <hi>rest</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſeems to have been appointed. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religious Offices upon one day in ſeven; but did not ceaſe from all Labour until now. Theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words ſeem to ſhow, there had been ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> heretofore, and was not wholly a new thing: for if it had, they could not have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor known what he meant. See what I have noted upon the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> where I thought it reaſonable to aſſert, That God intended to preſerve a Memory of the Creation in ſix days, by appointing the ſeventh day to be kept holy. And
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60246:154"/>therefore the more pious any people were, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſpect they had to this day. But when the World grew very wicked before the Flood, as they little thought of God, ſo it is likely they neglected all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between this day and others. And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion of People after the Flood, very much blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it out of their minds, as it did many other good things. But in the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we may well ſuppoſe, it was continued; though not with ſuch ſtrict abſtinence from all Labour, as, for ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, was afterward enjoyned. Which is the cauſe why we read nothing of their reſting in their Travels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day, before their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Where they were under ſuch cruel Servitude, that all obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, it is likely, was laid aſide: they being preſſed, day and night, by their Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters to hard Labour without intermiſſion. And therefore when God brought them out of that Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, he renewed his Command for the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> with this addition (in memory of their Deliverance from the Egyptian Bondage) that they ſhould reſt from all manner of Labour upon that day. Both theſe Reaſons are given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> why God commanded it to be obſerved, <hi>in memory of the Creation in ſix days,</hi> XX Exod. 11. <hi>and in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their deliverance from the Egyptian Bondage,</hi> V Deut. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bake that which you will bake to day,</hi> &amp;c.] The words <hi>to day,</hi> are not in the Hebrew; but are neceſſary to make the ſenſe plain, becauſe they were enjoyned on this day to <hi>prepare,</hi> or make ready all things againſt the next, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:60246:154"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept till the morning.</hi>] From which words ſome have inferred, that there was no prohibition of <hi>baking</hi> and <hi>ſeething</hi> on the Sabbath, but the contrary rather is here ſuppoſed; (See Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> Part. I. p. 100.) But I do not ſee, how this conſiſts with the further explication of this matter in XXXV <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. where they are forbidden to kindle a Fire upon this day. Unleſs any one will ſay, that for the preſent they might do it; but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after were prohibited: which is not at all likely. For the plain meaning is, that if they would make any baked Meats, or boiled, with the <hi>Manna,</hi> they muſt do it upon the ſixth day: though what they did not then bake, nor boil, they might ſafely keep till the next day, and it ſhould not breed Worms, nor ſtink. But what they ſo kept, was to be eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baking or boiling, as it well might; being a food prepared in Heaven for their eating, without any need of further Art. And therefore called <hi>Bread,</hi> even when they gathered it, <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And they laid it up until the morning,</hi> &amp;c.] Without any Preparation of it by <hi>baking</hi> or <hi>boiling;</hi> and it kept the whole ſeventh day without any putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, Eat that to day.</hi>] Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it is, without <hi>baking</hi> or <hi>boiling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For to day is a Sabbath unto the LORD.</hi>] The frequent repetition of this in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and again <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. hath led the Jews into this miſtake, that the Sabbath was not ordained by God till they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> directly contrary to what we read in the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that it was inſtituted from the beginning. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> here only
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60246:155"/>gives an account, why this Precept was renewed at their coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> when there was a new Religious obſervation added to it, which was not neceſſary before, <hi>viz.</hi> reſting wholly from all manner of work. There is an excellent Diſcourſe on this Subject, in a late Learned Author, <hi>J. Wagenſiel</hi> (in his <hi>Confutation of R. Lipman</hi>'s <hi>Carmen Memoriale, p.</hi> 559, &amp;c.) who well obſerves, that, this Precept ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a peculiar reſpect to the Jews, we are not bound to obſerve the <hi>rest of the Sabbath</hi> with ſuch ſtrictneſs, as they did; but only as the Patriarchs did, before the giving of the Law, <hi>p.</hi> 564. As for the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day from the <hi>ſeventh</hi> to the <hi>first</hi> day of the Week, it is impoſſible for the Jews to prove, that the day they obſerve is the <hi>ſeventh</hi> from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And beſides that, the whole World cannot be tied to the circumſtance of time preciſely: for in ſome parts of it, the Sabbath will fall <hi>eighteen</hi> hours later than in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> as he evidently ſhows, <hi>p.</hi> 572, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To day you ſhall not find it in the field.</hi>] This <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaid to them, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks, in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath: which was, in effect, a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to them, not to go out to gather it on that day.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Six days ye ſhall gather it,</hi> &amp;c.] The ſame Author thinks this is repeated to ſignifie, that as long as they continued in the Wilderneſs, they ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſix days in a Week, as they did now: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find any on the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There ſhall be none.</hi>] As you reſt, ſaith he, from doing any thing about the Manna, ſo God will ceaſe from ſending it unto you. Upon which he makes this pious reflection, That in this World we muſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60246:155"/>work for our Souls, if we would be happy in the next World, which is an intire Sabbath or Reſt. <hi>For he that labours in the Evening of the Sabbath, ſhall eat on the Sabbath.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Origen,</hi> long before him, <hi>Hom.</hi> VII. in <hi>Exod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>There went out ſome of the people on the ſeventh day to gather,</hi> &amp;c.] The ſame wicked diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition remained in them, which made them on other days keep it till next Morning, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>how long refuſe ye to keep my Commandments,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe chiding words, are full of indignation; and yet ſignifie the long-ſuffering Patience of God, with an untoward Generation. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> expounds this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as if, upon this occaſion, he upbraided them with all their other Tranſgreſſions; ſaying,
<q>You kickt againſt me at the Red Sea, and believed not my words: at <hi>Marah</hi> alſo you murmured; and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very diſcontented words at <hi>Elim.</hi> Nay, after I had given you <hi>Manna,</hi> you violated my Precept, in reſerving it till the next Morning. And now you break my Sabbath: what hope is there that you will obſerve any of my Laws?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Refuſe to keep my Commandments and my Laws.</hi>] He ſpeaks thus, ſay ſome of the Jews, becauſe that in which they now offended, is a thing upon which the whole Law, all his Commandments depend. So the ſame <hi>Abarbinel.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> inſtructed them in the Creation of the World, upon which all the Law depends, therefore he ſaith, <hi>My Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and my Laws.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For that the LORD hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you, on the ſixth day, the bread of

                  <hi>Let no man go out of his place.</hi>] The Jews ſay that a Man went <hi>out of his place,</hi> if he went above Two thouſand paces, from his dwelling. That is, if he went beyond the Suburbs of his City, XXXV <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>So the people reſted on the ſeventh day.</hi>] The Reprehenſion which God gave them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 28.) and the ſolemn renewal of the Precept, (<hi>v.</hi> 29.) wrought ſo much upon them, that for the preſent they reſted upon this day. And, they not having been uſed to this reſt, God did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately puniſh their Diſobedience in going abroad to gather Manna: though afterward he ordered a Man to be ſtoned for gathering Sticks on this day; for he had often repeated this Law to them, before that time.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>called the name thereof Manna.</hi>] This is repeated again, to ſhow that the name which they gave it at firſt, (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to it afterward: being ſo apt and proper to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie God's Providence over them, that they could find no better.</p>

And therefore the Ark is called <hi>the Teſtimony;</hi> partly becauſe there God gave them a ſpecial Token of his Dwelling among them; and partly becauſe the two Tables of Stone were in the Ark, which are called <hi>the Teſtimony,</hi> XL. 20. Where it is ſaid, <hi>Moſes</hi> put <hi>the Teſtimony into the Ark:</hi> and then immediately, <hi>v.</hi> 21. he calls it, <hi>the Ark of the Teſtimony.</hi>

               <p>But there are thoſe who fancy theſe words were put into this Book, after <hi>Moſes</hi> his death: for which I can ſee no ground.

               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>An Omer is the tenth part of an Ephah.</hi>] From hence alſo ſome would fain conclude, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not write this: becauſe, ſay they, it is not uſual when Meaſures are in common uſe, to tell in other words how much they contained; which then only is proper, when they are grown out of uſe. But ſuch Obſervations ſeem to proceed from an humour of Cavilling. For why may not an Author ſet down diſtinctly, things very well known in his time, that Poſterity alſo may have as diſtinct a knowledge of them? Beſides, the very ſame Men complain on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions, that the Writers of Hiſtory have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give us an account of ſeveral things, which in their time were moſt notorious; whereby Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſuffers much, for want of ſuch Information. Nor do I ſee any proof, that theſe Meaſures were not as common in after times, as they were when <hi>Moſes</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Several Learned Men have taken a great deal of pains, to reduce theſe Meaſures to thoſe of the Greeks and Romans, particularly <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in his Epiſtles (N. LXVII.) and <hi>Herman. Conringius</hi> in a Treatiſe on this Subject <hi>de Menſuris Hebraicis.</hi> But none have done it ſo clearly and exactly, as a very Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our own Country (Biſhop <hi>Cumberland,</hi> in his <hi>Scripture Weights and Meaſures, Cap.</hi> 3.) who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes an <hi>Ephah</hi> to have contained <hi>ſeven</hi> Wine-Gallons,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60246:158"/>a Pottle and half a Pint: So that an <hi>Omer</hi> was near <hi>three</hi> Quarts: which, if any one imagine too great a proportion to be allowed to one Perſon every day, he propounds theſe things to be conſidered: That <hi>Manna,</hi> being of a globular figure, (like Coriander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed) muſt needs have many empty ſpaces between every <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Grains; and thoſe vacuities may reaſonably be eſtimated a <hi>third</hi> part of the Veſſels capacity. And it being a light Aerial Food, muſt needs be inwardly porous, and of a ſpungy contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of parts. So that it waſted ſomething in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Fire, as it melted by the Sun when it grew hot. And conſequently three Quarts might, it is probable, be reduced to three Pints of an Oily li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Subſtance. Which was not too much in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Deſert, where they might well be thought to have refreſhed themſelves thrice a day. See alſo what I have noted before, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>

                  <hi>Saying, Give us Water,</hi> &amp;c.] The word for <hi>give</hi> is in the Plural Number: and therefore this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to <hi>Aaron;</hi> though <hi>Moſes</hi> be only mention'd as the Perſon they contended with.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60246:159"/>it further, and will have this Speech directed to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and to <hi>God,</hi> becauſe they came hither by God's Commandment: which made them inſolently ſay, if by God's Providence we were brought to this place, let him take care we be not killed with thirſt.</p>

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the People thirſted there for Water.</hi>] This looks like a needleſs Repetition; it being ſaid before, there was no Water in this place, (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) which made the People chide with <hi>Moſes,</hi> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into ſuch an inconvenient Station. But if we conſider it well, we ſhall find it a neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the grouth and progreſs of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.

And now, when after a day or two it was all gone, they were really very thirſty, and ſo fell into the murmuring here ſpoken of, from a ſenſe of their Miſery, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only out of a fear of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the people murmured against</hi> Moſes.] They proceeded from a lower, to a higher degree of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: which made them at firſt only expoſtulate and argue with him; but now they <hi>murmur</hi> againſt him; and at length fell into ſuch a rage, that they ſeemed to be ready to ſtone him, <hi>v.</hi> 4.

               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore is this, that thou hast brought us out of</hi> Egypt?] This ſhows the neceſſity of preſerving the Remembrance of God, and of his Benefits in our Minds.

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Go on before the People.</hi>] Be not afraid of their ſtoning, (ſaith the ſame <hi>Aharbinel</hi>) but though they murmur, and are in a great paſſion, and impatient, go on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them confidently through the midſt of their Camps; and thou ſhalt ſee they ſhall not touch the hem of thy Garment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And take with thee of the Elders of</hi> Iſrael.] Not valiant young Men to thy Life-guard; but grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be Witneſſes, that thou doſt really bring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a Rock; and the People may not ſay there was a Spring there before.

               <p>When he is commanded to march before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is ſuppoſed they were to follow: but they could not all move ſo ſoon as he and the Elders, who
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60246:161"/>went before to the very place. Which the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People could not do; the paſſage to the Rock, it is likely, being narrow; ſo that they could not all ſee him ſmite the Rock, and behold the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guſh out; but expected till it flowed from thence unto their Camp.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Behold, I will ſtand before thee there upon the Rock.</hi>] That is, <hi>the Glory of the LORD,</hi> which in the Cloud appeared in this place (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> truly expounds it) to ſtrengthen his Faith; and to perſwade the <hi>Elders,</hi> that this Water was Divinely given them, even as the <hi>Manna</hi> was. For before that fell from above, the Glory of the LORD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, (XVI. 10.) as it did now, before this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flowed to them from the Rock. So that they were fed continually by the Divine Providence; from whence they received both their Meat and their Drink.</p>
               <p>There is an Emphatical <hi>He</hi> (as they call it) before the word for <hi>Rock;</hi> and therefore it ſhould be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>upon that Rock.</hi> Where <hi>Abarbinel</hi> fancies the LORD was wont to appear to <hi>Moſes:</hi> but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rocky place, it may only denote that particular part of the Rock to which God directed him to go; and was the ſame (that Author probably thinks) with that mentioned XXXIII. 22.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes, Aaron <hi>and</hi> Hur, <hi>went up to the top of the Hill.</hi>] The Jews do but conjecture who this <hi>Hur</hi> was: But we may be certain he was a Perſon of great Eminence for Wiſdom and Piety; otherwiſe he would not have been joyned with the Leaders of God's People, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> We read indeed 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 19. of one <hi>Hur,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,</hi> and Grandfather of the famous <hi>Bezaleel;</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> But there is nothing to perſwade us that he was the Perſon here ſpoken of; nor that he was the Son of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Siſter, as ſome of the Jews tell us. See <hi>Pirke Elieſer, c.</hi> 45. where ſtrange Stories are told of him. But it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he was <hi>Miriam's</hi> Husband, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 2. though we cannot tell whence he himſelf was deſcended.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>When</hi> Moſes <hi>held up his hand.</hi>] Lifting up the hands was a poſture of Prayer, and imploring the Divine Aid, as we find in many places; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly III <hi>Lament.</hi> 40. <hi>Let us lift up our hearts with our hands, to God in the Heavens.</hi> And it implies great Earneſtneſs in Prayer; as doth alſo <hi>liſting up the eyes,</hi> and <hi>liſting up the ſoul,</hi> XXV <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60246:163"/>But though this be true, and no doubt <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Companions prayed to God moſt earneſtly, yet this was not the occaſion of his <hi>lifting up his hand;</hi> which was to advance the <hi>Rod of God,</hi> which he held in his hand, and lifted up as their <hi>Standard</hi> or Banner, to which they ſhould look, and hope for help from the mighty Power of God, who had done ſuch Wonders by that Rod.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Iſrael <hi>prevailed.</hi>] The ſight of the Rod of God, inſpired them with ſuch Courage, that their Enemies could not ſtand before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when he let down his hand,</hi> Amalek <hi>prevailed.</hi>] Their Spirits flagged, when they did not ſee the Rod; and they began to give ground: imagining perhaps that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſpaired of Victory; who (the Fight being long) was not able alway to keep his hand erect.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>But Moſes his hands were heavy.</hi>] Through wearineſs, by long holding them out upon the ſtretch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they took a ſtone and put it under him, and he ſate thereon.</hi>] It ſeems he had been ſtanding before; which gave them the greater advantage of ſeeing the Rod, but made him the more weary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>and</hi> Hur <hi>ſtayed up his hands.</hi>] Were his Supporters; which it is probable was in this manner. Sometimes <hi>Moſes</hi> held up the Rod in his right hand, and ſometimes in his left (for <hi>v.</hi> 11. he ſpeaks only of one <hi>hand</hi> which was lifted up, or let down) and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtood on one ſide of him, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his right hand) and <hi>Hur</hi> ſtood on the other. Who, by that means, helpt by turns to uphold his hands in that poſture: for if they had done it both together, they might have been as weary as he.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And his hands were ſteady,</hi> &amp;c.] Were kept up ſtretched out, without falling down, till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And</hi> Joſhua <hi>diſcomfited</hi> Amalek <hi>and his People,</hi> &amp;c.] Routed their whole Army.

                  <hi>And rehearſe it in the ears of</hi> Joſhua.] That he, who was to be the Leader of God's People after <hi>Moſes,</hi> might never enter into any League with the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> For his Proſperity depended upon the Obſervation of the Commands given by God to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> which therefore were carefully written in a Book, and delivered to him, that they might not be forgotten.

For as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons are ſometimes puniſhed very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, for an Example to others; ſo are Families and Nations.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60246:166"/>Which is called <hi>God's Mount,</hi> becauſe there he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſirſt to <hi>Moſes,</hi> III. 2, &amp;c. and had lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there again upon the Rock, XVII. 6. unto which place he bid <hi>Moſes</hi> lead the Congregration, (XVII. 5.) who were now, I ſuppoſe, incamped thereabout, after the ſight with <hi>Amalek</hi> in <hi>Rephidim;</hi> which was not far from it.</p>

               <p>Here it may be ſit to take notice, that there is a great diſpute among Interpreters, about the time when <hi>Jethro</hi> came from <hi>Midian,</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi> his Wife and Children: whether immediately after the Fight with <hi>Amalek,</hi> as it is here ſet down; or ſome time after, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were better ſettled.

Some ſay it was in this firſt year, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have an opinion, that it was in the Month of <hi>Tiſri,</hi> and on the <hi>eleventh</hi> day of that Month, when <hi>Jethro</hi> gave the following Counſel to <hi>Moſes,</hi> v. 19, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> above <hi>three</hi> Months after God gave the Law from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> or after <hi>Moſes</hi> received the <hi>ſecond</hi> Tables. But others are as conſident that it was in the <hi>ſecond</hi> year; and place this Story according to order of time after X <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. or as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks, it ſhould come in between the 10th and 11th Verſes of that <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>Numbers.</hi> And Primate <hi>

But though all this be uncertain, yet Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> thinks he hath a ſtrong ground to affirm, it was after the giving of the Law, from what we read I <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. And I confeſs it ſeems plain from thence, that the Regulation which <hi>Moſes</hi> made by the advice of <hi>Jethro,</hi> was <hi>after God ſpake to them in</hi> Horeb, which is the ſame with Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> For though he did appear at <hi>Horeb</hi> before this (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved XVII. 6.) yet he ſaid nothing then of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions (I <hi>Deut.</hi>) which was after the giving of the Law. At which time he ſaith there (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) it was that he told them, <hi>he was not able to bear them himſelf alone,</hi> &amp;c. But notwithſtanding this, I cannot think that the <hi>coming</hi> of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> was deferred ſo long (for no reaſon can be given why <hi>Moſes</hi> here places the Story of it, if it did not follow their Fight with <hi>Amalek</hi>) though he did not
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60246:167"/>give him the <hi>advice</hi> for the better Adminiſtration of Juſtice, till after God had delivered the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> as I ſhall obſerve in its proper place.</p>

                  <hi>And did obeyſance and kiſſed him.</hi>] Welcomed him according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they asked each other of their welfare.</hi>] Had ſuch diſcourſe together, as Friends commonly have at their meeting, till they came into the Tent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they came into the Tent.</hi>] Into the Tent of <hi>Moſes;</hi> or rather the Tent prepared to entertain <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro.</hi> But the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> are ſo poſſeſſed with the opinion, that this hapned ſome Months, if not a whole Year, after the Law was given, that they take this <hi>Tent</hi> to have been <hi>Beth-midraſh,</hi> the Houſe of Expoſition; or the School where <hi>Moſes</hi> made the People underſtand the Law. For ſo <hi>Jonathan</hi> in his Paraphraſe upon this, and the foregoing Verſe; <hi>I thy Father-in-law am come unto thee, that I may be made a Proſelyte.

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>told his Father-in-law, all that the LORD had done to</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] It ſeems to me, from theſe words, and thoſe that follow, that all
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60246:168"/>we read hitherto about this matter, fell out in order of time as it is here ſet down. For if it had hapned after the giving of the Law, it is moſt probable, he would have ſaid ſomething of the moſt remarkable paſſage of all other, Gods glorious appearance to them on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Law he had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas, at this meeting, he only relates what God had done to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and how the <hi>LORD delivered</hi> them; and <hi>all the Travel that came upon them by the way:</hi> which comprehends their paſſing through the Red Sea, and their want of Water and Bread, and their Fight with <hi>Amalek.</hi> That is, all that we read in the foregoing Chapters. And accordingly <hi>Jethro</hi> rejoyced for their deliverance from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> v. 9. and gives thanks to God for it, <hi>v.</hi> 10. taking notice of nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And</hi> Jethro <hi>rejoyced for all the goodneſs which the LORD had done to</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c.] The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as <hi>Conradus Pellicanus</hi> here obſerves, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly acknowledged God's Mercies when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them, than the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did.

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD who hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you out of the hand of the Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.] This may relate to the Preſervation of <hi>Moſes and</hi> Aaron, who had brought the ſoreſt Plagues upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and yet God ſuffered them not to hurt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath delivered the People from under the hand of the Egyptians.</hi>] And then this relates to the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the whole Body of the People from the Egyptian Bondage; and to the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:60246:168"/>and his Hoſt in the Red Sea: whereby the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſinally delivered <hi>from under the hand,</hi> i. e. the tyranny and oppreſſion of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.</hi>] If we refer this to what immediately goes before (<hi>viz. all Gods</hi>) the meaning is, that the LORD appeared ſuperiour to all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Gods, who inſolently attempted, by the Magicians, to equal him in his wonderful Works; but were baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled and expoſed to contempt, and at laſt thrown down in their Images, VIII. 19. IX. 11. XII. 12. But it is commonly thought to relate to the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> mention'd in the foregoing Verſe: and then the meaning is, That the LORD confounded them, that proudly contemned his Authority, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who is the LORD,</hi> &amp;c. V. 2. whom he forced to beg his pardon, IX. 27. and at laſt drowned him and his Hoſt in the Red Sea, when they ſaid, in an haughty, boaſting manner, <hi>I will purſue, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, I will divide the ſpoil, my lust ſhall be ſatisfied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> &amp;c. XV. 9. And to this purpoſe the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> expounds it; <hi>In that very thing wherein they thought to judge (i. e.</hi> to puniſh or deſtroy) <hi>the</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <hi>they were judged themſelves; i. e.</hi> drowned in
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60246:169"/>the Sea, as they intended to drown all their Male Children.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And</hi> Jethro Moſes <hi>Father-in-law.</hi>] He is conſtantly thus deſcribed (<hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where elſe but <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10.) to diſtinguiſh him from any other <hi>Jethro;</hi> to whom theſe things might poſſibly be thought to belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Took a Burnt-offering.</hi>] Which was to be wholly conſumed upon the Altar, and nothing of it eaten by any body, I <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. This now may be thought to have been done, after the giving of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> here mentions becauſe he would put together all that belongs to <hi>Jethro</hi>'s ſtory (though not all done at the very ſame time) juſt, as I ſaid he did what belonged to the Hiſtory of the <hi>Manna,</hi> XVI. 33, 35. See there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Sacrifices.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Peace-offerings; of which the People, as well as the Prieſts, were to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, VII <hi>Lev.</hi> 34. XXVI <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. And regularly there never was any <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> made, which were wholly conſumed upon the Altar, but <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> attended upon them; if they were not <hi>Offerings for the whole Congregation,</hi> but for particular Perſons; that ſo, they who brought them, might Feaſt alſo with God upon the Sacrifices. For feaſting upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſices was an Appendix unto all Sacrifices whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, one way or other; if not by themſelves, yet by the Prieſts, who eat of the <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> as the Proxies of the People. Of this there are numerous Inſtances, not only among the Jews, after the Law was given, but among other People, who had this Cuſtom antecedent to it: As appears from XXV <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. where the <hi>Midianites</hi> invite the <hi>Iſraelites to the Sacrifices of their Gods, and the People did eat,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:60246:169"/>Which they did not learn from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but derived from higher Antiquity; it is probable even from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God.</hi>] To be offered unto God. Who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them we are not told; but it ſhould ſeem by the word <hi>took,</hi> that <hi>Jethro</hi> himſelf (who was a Prieſt) was permitted to perform this Office; in token that they owned him to be a faithful Servant and Miniſter of the moſt High God, as <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was. And accordingly it follows that <hi>Aaron</hi> was invited, with the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to come and Feaſt with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>came.</hi>] This ſeems to ſignifie, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was but a Gueſt, and had not been the Prieſt who offered the Sacrifice. For though we ſuppoſe the Law to have been now given, yet it is likely <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and his Sons were not yet conſecrated, nor the Service of God, as yet ordered, according to the Law that had been delivered; no more then Judicatures were erected, as after this they were by the advice of <hi>Jethro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of theſe things we can have no abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, but only make probable conjectures.</p>

               <p>For all theſe good qualities, they were to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and noted among the People, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his words import, I <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. where he bids them preſent to him, not only <hi>wiſe men and underſtanding,</hi> but alſo <hi>known among their Tribes;</hi> generally accounted Men of Underſtanding and Integrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And place ſuch over them, to be Rulers of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew words are ſuch, that it cannot be determined by them, whether this relate to the number of <hi>Rulers,</hi> or of <hi>People</hi> that were to be ruled by them; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves and diſcourſes upon it very largely, in the ſore-mentioned place, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 615. Where he ſhows that <hi>Decem vir,</hi> for inſtance, was not only one ſet over <hi>ten;</hi> but one of the <hi>ten</hi> Judges of which a Court conſiſted: and ſo the reſt may be interpreted. But the moſt ancient and moſt received Senſe is, that he doth not ſpeak of the Number of Judges (for what a ſtrange Court would that be in which there was a Thouſand Judges?) but of the People, of whoſe Cauſes they were to take cognizance: And it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought alſo there was but one Ruler over a <hi>Thouſand</hi> (<hi>Families</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> it is uncertain which) and ſo of the reſt: though the words may import more than one, in each of theſe Judicatures; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater or ſmaller. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of Judges of each ſort; but it is moſt rational to think that <hi>Jethro</hi>'s meaning was, That he ſhould conſtitute greater and leſſer Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the Diviſion of their ſeveral Tribes, into <hi>Thouſands, Hundreds, Fifties</hi> and <hi>Tens;</hi> and a competent number of Perſons appointed to be Judges in theſe greater or leſſer Courts.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:60246:172"/>
               <p>For that their Tribes were divided into <hi>Thouſands</hi> (for inſtance) is apparent from ſeveral places, XXII <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14. VI <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.

And of theſe he thinks <hi>Jethro</hi> adviſes him to make ſuch Rulers, as are here mentioned, of ſeveral degrees. But others, particularly <hi>Herman. Conringius de Republ. Hebr.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rulers of hundreds, Rulers of fifties, and Rulers of tens.</hi>] There were <hi>four</hi> orders of theſe Rulers: but whether there was a ſubordination of the lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the higher, as in Armies there is of the <hi>Captain</hi> to the <hi>Colonel,</hi> (as we now ſpeak) and the Inferiors to him, I cannot determine.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And let them judge the People at all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>] Sit every day, ſome or other of them, in their ſeveral Diſtricts. See <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every great matter they ſhall bring to thee.</hi>] Not if they were able to determine it themſelves. For they had power to hear all Cauſes; but when they found any too difficult, they were to refer it to be heard by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf. So <hi>R. Leviben Gerſom</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it; <hi>Every great Cauſe, in which they know not what to judge, they ſhall bring to thee, and thou ſhalt ſhow what is right:</hi> or how it is to be decided.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:60246:173"/>
               <p>There are thoſe indeed who think there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Cauſes, that might not be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Inferiour Courts; but were to be reſerved for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hearing and judging. Theſe they make to be <hi>Four: First,</hi> All Sacred Matters, or Things, belonging unto God; which they gather from <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Matters of Equity; where the rigour of the Law was ſit to be mitigated. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cauſes. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Such as the <hi>Chiliarchs, i. e.</hi> Rulers of Thouſands, and the other Judges referred to him. But this is ſaid without ground; for it is plain, all ſorts of Cauſes might be determined by the inferiour Courts, if they were able to make an end of them, whether Civil or Sacred. Only thoſe which were too difficult for them; that is, when they did not find a Law to direct them, or it was obſcure, or they could not agree about the Puniſhment, then they were to be brought before <hi>Moſes.</hi> So he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf charges; not that the <hi>People</hi> ſhould bring ſuch Cauſes to him as they thought difficult; but that the <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves ſhould bring them; <hi>i. e.</hi> order an Appeal to him, I <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>bring it unto me</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judges) <hi>and I will hear it.</hi> Which ſhows the Cauſe had been at the Bar of other Courts before, and that it was not unlawful for them to meddle with it, if they had been able to determine it. And accordingly we read here below, <hi>v.</hi> 26. that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es did ſo. In ſhort, theſe words do not intimate that there were ſome Cauſes the other Judges might not try, if they were able; but only that ſuch things as they found themſelves not skilful enough to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, they ſhould bring to him. See Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the fore-named Book, <hi>p.</hi> 633, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But every ſmall matter they ſhall judge.</hi>] Hitherto <hi>Moſes</hi> but heard all Cauſes promiſcuouſly, great and ſmall: but <hi>Jethro</hi> well adviſes him to delegate the labour of judging all Cauſes <hi>liquidi juris,</hi> (as the Lawyers ſpeak) where the Right was clear: and to reſerve no part of the Judicature to himſelf, but where the Law it ſelf was either defective or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So ſhall it be caſier for thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] Thou wilt eaſe thy ſelf of a great burden, by appointing others to take their ſhare of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>If thou wilt do this thing, and God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee ſo.</hi>] If thou wilt follow this advice, by God's approbation; who was to be conſulted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he allowed it.</p>

                  <hi>Then thou ſhalt be able to endure.</hi>] Thy days will be prolonged; which otherwiſe will be ſhortned with this intolerable labour.</p>

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>So</hi> Moſes <hi>hearkened to the voice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,</hi> &amp;c.] Followed his Counſel, by God's approbation, with whom no doubt he adviſed, <hi>v.</hi> 23.

                  <hi>If you will obey my voice indeed,</hi> &amp;c.] If you will ſincerely obey me, as your King and Governour, and keep the Covenant I intend to make with you, then you ſhall be mine above all the People of the Earth: whoſe LORD I am, as well as yours: but you ſhall be my peculiar Inheritance; in which I will eſtabliſh my Kingdom and Prieſthood; with ſuch Laws as ſhall not only diſtinguiſh you from all other Nations, but make you to excel them. This is the ſenſe of this verſe, and the following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A peculiar treaſure unto me.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Very dear to me; and conſequently I will take a ſingular care of you, as Kings do of thoſe things which they lay up in their Treaſury. So the Hebrew word <hi>Segullah</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. Which <hi>Origen</hi> proves they really were, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Calumnies of <hi>Celſus</hi>) their Laws being ſo profitable; and they being ſo early taught to know God, to believe the Immortality of the Soul, and the Rewards and Puniſhments in the Life to come; and bred up to a contempt of <hi>Divination,</hi> (with which Mankind had been abuſed) as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather from wicked Daemons, than from any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Nature; and to ſeek for the knowledge of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60246:176"/>future things in Souls, which by an extraordinary degree of Purity, were rendred capable to receive the Spirit of God, <hi>L. V. contra Celſum, p.</hi> 260. And this the Author of <hi>Sepher Coſri</hi> happily expreſſes, when he ſaith, <hi>Our peculiar Bleſſings conſist in the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Minds with God, by Prophecy, and that which is annexed to it:</hi> that is (as <hi>Muſcatus</hi> explains it) <hi>the Gift of the Spirit of God.</hi> And therefore he doth not ſay in the Law, if you will obey my voice, I will bring you after Death into Gardens of Pleaſure, but <hi>ye ſhall be to me a People, and I will be to you a God,</hi> Pars I. Sect. 109.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For all the Earth is mine.</hi>] Which made it the greater honour, that he bare ſuch a ſpecial love to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And ye ſhall be unto me a Kingdom of Prieſts.</hi>] An honourable, or a Divine Kingdom: not like worldly Kingdoms, which are defended by Arms, but ſupported by Piety. Or a Princely People, that ſhould rule over their Enemies. For the ſame word ſignifies both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Princes:</hi> and in the firſt times of the World none was thought fit to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> but he who was a King, or the Chief of the Family; as we ſee in <hi>Melchizedek</hi> and <hi>Jethro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God was peculiarly the King of this People, I obſerved above, III. 10. and here he expreſly owns this peculiar Dominion over them, by ſaying, Ye ſhall be <hi>to me</hi> a Kingdom. And one reaſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, why he ſaith they ſhall be <hi>a Kingdom of Prieſts,</hi> is, becauſe they were governed (while they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a <hi>Theocracy</hi>) by the High Prieſt, as the prime Miniſter under God, who in all weighty Cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted God what was to be done; and accordingly they ordered their Affairs, XXVIII. 30. XXVIII
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60246:177"/>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. Which is the reaſon why God commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to make ſuch Garments for <hi>Aaron</hi> as ſhould be for <hi>glory and beauty,</hi> (or, for <hi>honour and glory</hi>) as we read <hi>v.</hi> 2. of that Chapter; <hi>i.e.</hi> to make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear great, like a Prince; for they were really Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Garments. And for his Sons alſo, he was to make Bonnets of the like kind <hi>for honour and glory,</hi> v. 40. they being in the form of the <hi>Tiarae</hi> which Kings wore; and are joyned in Scripture with <hi>Crowns,</hi> XXIX <hi>Job</hi> 14. III <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23, &amp;c. Whence <hi>Philo</hi> ſays, in his Book <hi>de Sacerd. Honoribus,</hi> that the Law manifeſtly dreſſed up the High Prieſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But the liberty and freedom alſo wherein they were inſtated, I doubt not is ſignified by theſe words, <hi>Kings and Prieſts,</hi> (as <hi>Onkelos</hi> tranſlates them, and as it is expreſſed in the New Teſtament, I <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. V. 10. and the <hi>Syriac</hi> alſo, <hi>Kingdom and Priesthood</hi>) for <hi>Kings and Prieſts</hi> were, of all other Men, freed from Oppreſſion. And thus I ſind our Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> a moſt Learned man, gloſſes upon theſs words, (<hi>Review of the Rights of the Church,</hi> p. 132.) God calls them <hi>Kings,</hi> becauſe redeemed from the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Strangers, to be a People Lords of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> becauſe redeemed to ſpend their time in Sacrificing, and feaſting upon their Sacrifices (under which Figure he afterwards repreſents the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate of his Church, LXI <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.) though they Sacrificed not in Perſon, but by their Prieſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſtead, by impoſition of the Elders hands, VIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An holy Nation.</hi>] A People ſeparated to God from all other Nations, and from their Idolatry, to ſerve God in an acceptable manner.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:60246:177"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are the words which thou ſhalt ſpeak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] The ſum of what he was to ſay to them; comprehending both their Duty and their high Priviledge.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>came.</hi>] Down from the Mount, where he had been with God, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And called for the Elders of the People.</hi>] The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Perſons in the ſeveral Tribes, (See III. 16.) which he ſeems to have done in the Evening of the <hi>ſecond</hi> day of the Month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And laid before their faces all theſe words,</hi> &amp;c.] Plainly declared to them, what God had given him in charge: which they went and propounded to the People of the ſeveral Tribes, whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And all the People anſwered together, and ſaid.</hi>] All with one conſent declared, as here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that the LORD hath ſpoken we will do.</hi>] They conſented to have the LORD for their King; and promiſed to be obedient to his Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>returned the words of the People unto the LORD.</hi>] This ſeems to have been done the next day, which was the <hi>third</hi> day of the third Month. Upon which Report made to God of the Peoples Conſent, he proceeds, after a few days preparation, to declare the Laws by which they ſhould be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, Chap. XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII. and then in the XXIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter theſe Laws paſs into a Covenant between God and them.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Moſes</hi> plainly acted as a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and the People.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>lo, I will come unto thee.</hi>] Appear upon the Mount.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:60246:178"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a thick Cloud.</hi>] In a darker Cloud than that, which had hitherto gone before them, to conduct them; ſo that they ſhould ſee nothing but Flaſhes of Lightning which came out of it, in a very frightful manner, (<hi>v.</hi> 16, 18.) For that there was ſire in it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from IV <hi>Dent.</hi> 11. V. 22, 23. though at firſt, perhaps, only a thick Cloud appeared, as a token of his approach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the People may hear when I ſpeak with thee.</hi>] Though they ſaw no Similitude, yet they plainly heard a voice ſpeaking unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and declaring their Duty. <hi>Maimonides</hi> indeed thinks that the words were directed only unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heard meerly the ſound of the words, but did not diſtinctly underſtand them, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 33. Which is directly againſt what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>The LORD ſpake unto you out of the midst of the ſire,</hi> &amp;c. and V. 4, 5. <hi>The LORD talked with you face to face in the Mount,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſaying, I am the LORD thy God,</hi> &amp;c. which words are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed to all the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And believe thee for ever.</hi>] They had been ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Belief, after they had profeſſed it at the Red Sea, (XV. <hi>ult.</hi>) but after this, it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they would never queſtion his Authority any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>told the words of the People unto the LORD.</hi>] Or rather, <hi>for</hi> Moſes <hi>had told,</hi> &amp;c. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account God was pleaſed to make the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Declaration. Till they had owned him for the <hi>LORD their God, i.e.</hi> their King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he did not ſpeak unto <hi>them</hi> at all; but only unto <hi>Moſes:</hi> But now, that they had conſented to be his, he reſolves to ſpeak audibly to them; and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60246:178"/>henceforth to dwell among them; and in order to it, ſix his Tabernacle with them. For which he gives order (Chap. XXV. &amp;c.) immediately after they had entred into Covenant, to do as they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Or theſe words (which ſeem to be a needleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition) may relate to that which follows, and be tranſlated thus: <hi>Moſes having told the words of the People unto the LORD, the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Go unto the People and ſanctifie them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Go unto the People and ſanctifie them to day and to morrow.</hi>] This ſhows that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent down early on the <hi>fourth</hi> day, to prepare them for the Appearance of the Divine Majeſty among them, by ſanctifying them; that is, ſeparating them from all Uncleanneſs; or rather from all common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Imployments; that they might give themſelves to Faſting and Prayer, and Abſtinence from other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lawful Pleaſures. For <hi>Pirke Elieſer</hi> takes Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from their Wives, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 15. as a part of this Sanctification, <hi>cap.</hi> 41. And ſo doth <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> in his Book <hi>de Vita Moſis, p.</hi> 178. And <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> obſerves, that Separation from Wine and ſtrong Drink, is called Holineſs in the Law of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> VI <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. and therefore may be thought part of the Sanctification here required, <hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And let them waſh their Clothes.</hi>] The Hebrews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, of waſhing their whole Bodies. For thus <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were to be conſecrated to their Office, XXIX. 4. XL. 12. and therefore thus the People were now to be made a holy People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the LORD, and made ſit for the Preſence of the Divine Majeſty. Under whoſe Wings (as they
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60246:179"/>ſpeak) none were received in future times, <hi>i.e.</hi> made Proſelytes, but by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (or waſhing of their whole Body) which was taken from this pattern. And accordingly, where we read in the Law of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Purifications by waſhing their Clothes in caſe of any Uncleanneſs, as XI <hi>Lev.</hi> 25, 28, 40. XIV. 8, 47. (where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of cleanſing a Leprous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) XXXI <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. (where he ſpeaks of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Soldiers) and many other Caſes, they underſtand it in the very ſame manner. In ſome caſes indeed it is expreſly preſcribed, XV <hi>Lev.</hi> 5, 6, 7. XVI. 26, &amp;c. and they expound all other, where <hi>Clothes</hi> only are mentioned, by the ſame Rule; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhows, <hi>I.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr, c.</hi> 3. where he obſerves, that in the Pagan Language, <hi>pure Garments</hi> ſignifie the waſhing of the whole Body. See <hi>p.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And be ready against the third day.</hi>] He doth not mean the third day of the Month; but the third day after this command to Sanctifie themſelves. In which they were bound to ſpend <hi>two</hi> intire days; and then the LORD promiſed to come down in all their ſight upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> That is, when they were fit to receive him, by their profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an holy People; of which that outward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a token.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the third day the LORD will come down,</hi> &amp;c.] Not from the Mount, but from Heaven <hi>upon Mount Sinai.</hi> On which the SCHECHINAH deſcended in a Cloud, which ſtruck a great awe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: For it was darker than the Pillar of the Cloud, by which they had been conducted hither; thorough which ſome rays, or glimpſe of a glorious Majeſty that was in it, broke forth upon them.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:60246:179"/>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet bounds unto the People round about.</hi>] To keep them at a due diſtance; out of a juſt reverence to the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, that ye go not up,</hi> &amp;c.] This Caution alſo was given them, to work and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in their Minds a moſt profound Reverence of the Divine Majeſty, and to thoſe Laws which were to be delivered from this Mount.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>There ſhall not an hand touch it, but he ſhall ſurely be ſtoned, or ſhot through.</hi>] Be ſtoned, if he were near at hand; or ſhot through with Darts or Arrows, if at a diſtance. So <hi>Aben-Ezra.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> likewiſe tranſlates the latter Clauſe, <hi>They ſhall throw Darts at him:</hi> And ſo our old Tranſlation, <hi>Stricken through with Darts.</hi> But the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> and the greateſt Lawyers among the Jews, expound both theſe Clauſes of <hi>ſtoning;</hi> which was twofold, as we read in the <hi>Miſna Tit. Sanhedrin. c.</hi> 6. either by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones at a Malefactor; or throwing him down from an high place upon Stones. And thus this laſt place imports in the Hebrew, and may properly be tranſlated, <hi>projiciendo projicietur,</hi> he ſhall be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown down; or, <hi>thrown down headlong.</hi> It is the very ſame word with that XV. 4. concerning the caſting <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chariots into the Sea. And this was a Puniſhment, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, like that among the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the <hi>Saxum Tarpeium,</hi> which the Jews inflicted upon ſome captive <hi>Edomites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXV. 12. and <hi>Jehu</hi> inflicted upon <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> IX. 32. On which ſtory <hi>R. Leviben Gerſom</hi> obſerves pertinently, That as ſhe cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> to be ſtoned, ſo ſhe was puniſhed her ſelf in the ſame kind: for ſtoning, ſaith he, was either by throwing Stones at Malefactors, or throwing them down upon Stones.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60246:180"/>To juſtifie which he alledges this place in <hi>Exodus.</hi> And <hi>David Kimchi</hi> makes the ſame Obſervation. See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 74, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>When the Trumpet ſoundeth long.</hi>] When the ſound of it is protracted, or drawn out; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was leſs terrible, then while it was ſhorter and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. See <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And they waſhed their Clothes.</hi>] See <hi>v.</hi> 10. Unto which add, that it is no wonder they uſed this Purification before the giving of the Law: which had been anciently in uſe, among their Anceſtors, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Solemn Occaſions. As appears by what I obſerved on XXXV <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. where <hi>Jacob,</hi> before the building of an Altar to God in <hi>Bethel,</hi> as he had vowed, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Family after this manner. For ſo <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> truly expounds theſe words <hi>be clean,</hi> waſh your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: which was the old Rite of cleanſing. See there.</p>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And the LORD came down upon Mount</hi> Sinai.] It is ſaid before that the LORD deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, <hi>v.</hi> 18. therefore the meaning here is, that the SCHECHINAH, or Divine Majeſty, ſetled there, to ſpeak unto the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the top of the Mount.</hi>] On the higheſt part of it, that there might be the greateſt diſtance between him and the People, who ſtood at the foot of it.</p>

                  <hi>And the LORD called up</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] He ſtood lower before, though not ſo low as the People: but now is called up higher, even to the very place where God was. And conſequently entred into the midſt of the fire and ſmoke, wherein the Mountain was wrapped, (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) upon God's Appearance there. From which, in all probability, the <hi>Perſians</hi> (who had heard or read what is here related) framed the ſtory of their <hi>Zoroaſter.</hi> Who, wandring in Deſert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was carried up to Heaven, and ſaw God incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Flames; which he could not behold with his own eyes, (the ſplendour of them was ſo great) but with eyes which the Angels lent him: and there he received from him a Book of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Huetius Demonſtr.

And therefore God ſends him down again immediately, to bid them remember the Charge he had given them, and not dare to come nearer than they were.</p>

But I have often obſerved this not to be true; being confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſeveral Examples of others who ſacrificed, and were not the Firſt-born. And lately there is a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, who, in a juſt Diſcourſe, hath overthrown this Opinion, (See <hi>Campeg. Vitringa Obſerv.

                  <hi>Which came near unto the LORD.</hi>] To perform Divine Services. By which one would think he ſpeaks of thoſe, who had been already imployed in this Office: for having before this built an Altar, (XVII. 15.) ſome think it probable Sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon it. But if it were only a Monument, and no Sacrifices were to be offered till they came to the Mount of God, who was to appoint them; then <hi>Moſes</hi> pickt out the moſt excellent Perſons (as I ſaid before) to perform this Service when they came there, XXIV. 5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lest the LORD break forth upon them.</hi>] Leſt when they come near to Sacrifice, God ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with their Uncleanneſs, and deſtroy them. This ſuppoſes, they might go nearer than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto the LORD, the People cannot come up to Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] He thought it was needleſs to go down to reſtrain the People; having given them the Charge, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. and <hi>ſet bounds about the Mount</hi> (as it here follows) by drawing a Line, perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which they ſhould not paſs, and thereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the Mount from them; which he calls <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it.</hi>

                  <hi>And thou ſhalt come up, and</hi> Aaron <hi>with thee.</hi>] After he had delivered this new Charge to them. Which was the more neceſſary, becauſe <hi>Aaron</hi> being alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, they might think likewiſe of ſharing in this Priviledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>with thee.</hi>] Unto whom God did this great honour; becauſe he was to be called ſhortly to the dignity of the High Prieſt: and would be the more reſpected by the People, when they ſaw him admitted far nearer unto God than they were.</p>

               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>So</hi> Moſes <hi>went down unto the People, and ſpake unto them.</hi>] Delivered the Meſſage to them, and to the Prieſts, as he was directed: And then (as he was alſo ordered) returned unto the Mount, and his Brother with him: but not to the top of the Mount, where he was before, (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) as appears from the <hi>nineteenth</hi> Verſe of the next Chapter: which ſhows that <hi>Moſes</hi> was there where the People might ſpeak to him; and therefore, if he went up now to the top of the Mount, he came down again, when the LORD ſpake audibly to them, and ſtood in a place where he might be a Mediator between them. So he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, V <hi>Dent.</hi> 4, 5. that when the LORD talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them face to face in the Mount, he <hi>ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the LORD and them.</hi> And accordingly it follows <hi>v.</hi> 23. of that Chapter, that when they heard the voice out of the midſt of the Darkneſs, <hi>they came near to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. which ſhows he was not far off from them, though nearer to God than they.</p>
               <p>But perhaps <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not come up into the Mount, till after the <hi>Ten words</hi> (or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) were ſpoken: when <hi>Moſes,</hi> we read XX. 21. <hi>drew near unto the thick darkneſs where God was;</hi> though we read nothing of <hi>Aaron</hi> there.

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>AND God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying.</hi>] After the Trumpet had ſummoned them all to attend, and ſounded a long time louder and louder, there came a Voice from the SCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINAH, or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> out of the midſt of the Fire (as we read IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. V. 4, 22.) that is, of the Angelical Hoſt, which incircled him, and appeared like Flames of Fire. Which made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay, the <hi>Law was ordained by Angels</hi> (III <hi>Gal.</hi> 19.) who were then in attendance upon the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as his Retinue, when he <hi>ſpake all theſe words,</hi> that follow to the end of the <hi>ſeventeenth</hi> Verſe; which are called the <hi>Ten words,</hi> or Commandments, in XXXIV. 28. And he <hi>ſpake</hi> them with ſo great a Voice, V <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. that all the People, who were very numerous, plainly heard them: which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wonderful.</p>
               <p>This was upon the <hi>ſixth</hi> day of the third Month, called <hi>Sivan.</hi> See <hi>Selden L.</hi> III. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c.] In this Preface to the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> he aſſerts his Right to give them Laws, not only in general, as he is the LORD of all, but by a peculiar Title he had to their Obedience; whom he had taken to himſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpecial manner, to be his People, by bringing them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Servitude under which they groaned there. This was a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit freſh in their Minds, and moſt apt to affect their Hearts: and therefore he doth not ſay (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60246:184"/>of <hi>Sepher Coſri</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Sect.</hi> 27.) <hi>I am the LORD of Heaven and Earth;</hi> or, <hi>I am thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> but, <hi>I am the LORD thy God,</hi> who have ſhown a particular favour and kindneſs to thee, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. When he became their <hi>King</hi> by a ſpecial Title, (as I obſerved III. 10.) and upon that account gave them theſe Laws, whereby they were to be governed: and gave them peculiarly to them (as the fore-named Author notes) who were tied to the Obſervance of them, by virtue of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and God's placing his Glory among them. Whereas, if they had been tied to them by virtue of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would have belonged to all Nations, as much as unto them. Thus He. <hi>Maimonides</hi> will have theſe words, <hi>I am the LORD thy God,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of God; and the next, (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> which two are the great Foundations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>More Nevoch.</hi> P. II. <hi>c.</hi> 33. And indeed the word JEHOVAH, or LORD, is generally thought to ſignifie, <hi>he who is of himſelf.</hi> And the next word <hi>ELOHIM</hi> (which is the moſt ancient Name of God in Scripture) Learned men of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the <hi>Arabick</hi> word <hi>Alaha,</hi> (there being no root in Hebrew remaining from whence it can ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly come) which ſignifies to <hi>worſhip, ſerve,</hi> and <hi>adore. Hottinger</hi> hath taken a great deal of pains, in his <hi>Hexaemeron,</hi> and elſewhere, to confirm this out of that, and out of the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Language alſo. The Jews ſay indeed, that <hi>Elohim</hi> is the name of <hi>Judgment,</hi> as <hi>Jehovah</hi> is of Mercy; but <hi>Abarbinel</hi> confutes this, to eſtabliſh a Notion of his own, (viz. <hi>the Omnipotent Cauſe of all things</hi>) which others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as much as he doth the former. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60246:184"/>moſt, I think, now reſt in the fore-named No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it properly ſignifies him, who only is to be religiouſly worſhipped and adored; as it follows in the next words.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods.</hi>] That is, <hi>believe in one God;</hi> or, <hi>believe there is no other God but me,</hi> as <hi>Nachman</hi> interprets it; and conſequently worſhip no other God. This is the great Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the Hebrews ſpeak) of the Law: for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever confeſſes any other God, he denies the whole Law. And they truly obſerve alſo, that this <hi>negative</hi> Precept includes the <hi>affirmative, viz.</hi> a Command to worſhip Him, the only God. As when <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaith, he would neither offer Burnt-offering, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to any other God, but the LORD; it is plain he meant, that he would Sacrifice to him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> V. 17. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> III. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before me.</hi>] As they were not to forſake Him, and worſhip ſome other God; ſo not to worſhip any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, <hi>together with Him,</hi> as many did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVII. 33. For in his Preſence he could not indure any Competitor.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> &amp;c.] The difference between <hi>Peſel,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>graven Image,</hi> and <hi>Temunah,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> ſeems to be, that the former was a protuberant Image, or a <hi>Statue</hi> made of Wood, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the other only a <hi>Picture</hi> drawn in colours upon a Wall, or Board, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Both which, ſome have thought, they were prohibited here ſo much as to make; whether it were the Image or Picture, of the Stars, or Birds, or Men, or Beaſts, or Fiſhes; for fear they ſhould be drawn to worſhip them. Thus it is certain <hi>Origen</hi> underſtood this Commandment,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60246:185"/>when he ſaid, there was not permitted to be ſo much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. a Picture-drawer, or a maker of Statues in their Commonwealth: to take away all occaſion of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens minds from the worſhip of God, <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>contra Celſ. p.</hi> 181. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> was of the ſame Opinion, <hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>Stromat.</hi> and <hi>Tertullian, L. de Spectaculis, c.</hi> 23. Which they derived, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the Jews, who from the time of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> to the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thought they were forbidden by this Law to make an Image or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of any Living Creature, eſpecially of a Man. This <hi>Harmannus Conringius</hi> hath plainly demonſtrated (in his <hi>Paradoxa de Nummis Ebraeorum, c.</hi> 5.) out of many places in <hi>Philo</hi> and in <hi>Joſephus.</hi> The latter of which tells us, <hi>L.</hi> XVIII. <hi>Archaeolog. c.</hi> 5. That all their Governours before <hi>Pilate,</hi> were wont to uſe Enſigns in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without the Image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in them, becauſe their Law forbad <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Images. And when <hi>Vitellius</hi> was to lead the <hi>Roman</hi> Army through <hi>Judaea</hi> againſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> with Images in their Enſigns, the People ran to meet him, beſeeching him to forbear it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for it was not conſonant to the Laws of their Country to ſee Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges brought into it.</hi> But whether this was the ancient Expoſition of the Law before thoſe times, may be doubted. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> think it was unlawful to make any Figures of Celeſtial Bodies, either promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or plain, though it were for Ornaments ſake: but as for Animals, they might make prominent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of them, except only of Men; the Images of whom they might draw on a plain; See <hi>Selden L.</hi> I. <hi>de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. c.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Which diſtinctions
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60246:185"/>moſt look upon as ungrounded; and the common Opinion is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> did not forbid the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an Image; but, that they ſhould not make them, to ſet up in the place of Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them.</hi>] If they ſaw an Image (as they muſt needs do in other Countries, though we ſuppoſe they had none among themſelves) he requires them not to uſe any geſture, or to do any thing that might ſignifie Reverence or Honour given to them. Such were <hi>proſtrating</hi> themſelves before them, <hi>bowing</hi> their bodies, <hi>kiſſing</hi> their hands; much leſs to <hi>offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> or <hi>burn Incenſe,</hi> &amp;c. to them. Here ſeems to be a plain gradation in this Commandment; three things being here forbidden, if we take the firſt part of it to ſignifie that they might not ſo much <hi>as make a graven Image, or any likeneſs</hi> of any thing, for fear they ſhould be tempted to Idolatry. But though this may be ſuppoſed to have been a ſin, yet not ſo great as the next, to <hi>bow down to them;</hi> which was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honour, too high to be paid unto any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. But was not the higheſt of all; which was to <hi>ſerve them,</hi> by offering Sacrifice, burning Incenſe, making Vows to them; or ſwearing by them; or conſecrating Temples to them; or lighting Candles before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I the LORD thy God am a jealous God.</hi>] This reaſon ſhows that this Commandment is different from the firſt, and not a part of it. For worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images is forbidden, not meerly becauſe he was their God, and there is but one God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He <hi>is a jealous God,</hi> who could not endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Corrival, or Conſort, in that which was proper to himſelf. And ſo the ancient Jews, and Chriſtians
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60246:186"/>alſo, before St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> took this for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. The <hi>Arabian</hi> Chriſtians, in later times, particularly <hi>Elmacinus,</hi> diſtinctly name the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in that order which we now do; as <hi>Hottinger</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Smegma Orientale, p.</hi> 436.</p>

                  <hi>The iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</hi>] This was threatned to terrifie them from this ſin, which would ruin their Families; being a kind of High Treaſon againſt the LORD of Heaven and Earth. Yet <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> underſtands it only of ſuch Children as trod in the ſteps of their Forefathers; for if they repented, the Puniſhment was mitigated, XXVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 40, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>

                     <hi>Viſiting the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> is threatned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Sin of Idolatry; as appears from what follows, that ſuch Sinners are called haters of him. And he mentions only <hi>to the fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> becauſe the moſt a Man can live to ſee of his Seed, is the fourth Generation. Accordingly God orders, ſaith he, that if any City prove Idolaters, the Inhabitants ſhould be deſtroyed utterly, and all that was therein, XIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 13, 14, 15. Fathers, Children, Grand-children, Great-grand-children,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60246:186"/>and the new-born Children, were all killed for the Sin of their Parents.</q> Hence he ſaith, VII <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. he repayeth them that hate him <hi>to their face:</hi> which is there twice mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of them that hate me.</hi>] For he looked on them, not only as Enemies, but as haters of him. It is an Obſervation of the ſame <hi>Maimonides,</hi> that in the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, we ſhall never find theſe words, <hi>Fury, Anger, Indignation, Jealouſie</hi> attributed to God, but when they ſpeak of Idolatry: nor any Man called an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to God,</hi> an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> an <hi>Hater</hi> of him, but only <hi>Idolaters,</hi> VI <hi>Deut.</hi> 14, 15.

P.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 36. which he repeats <hi>c.</hi> 54. <hi>No man is called an hater of God, but an Idolater;</hi> according to that XII <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. <hi>every abomination to the LORD which he hateth.</hi> By which it appears that they counted the Worſhippers of Images, <hi>Idolaters;</hi> though they did not think theſe Images to be Gods, (for no Man in the World ever thought an Image, made of Wood and Stone, Silver or Gold, to be the Creator of Heaven and Earth, or the Governour of the World) but took them only for things intermediate between God and them, as he there ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>This was a Law ſo well known to the ancient Heathens, that the beſt Menamong them would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no Images to be ſet up in their Temples. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>Numa</hi> forbad this to the Romans, which he learnt, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> thinks, from <hi>Moſes.</hi> Inſomuch, that for the ſpace of an <hi>Hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years,</hi> though they built Temples, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they made
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60246:187"/>no Image, neither Statue, nor ſo much as a Picture, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Stromat. p.</hi> 304. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates the ſame in the Life of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and adds this reaſon, that he thought it a great Crime to repreſent the moſt excellent Being, by ſuch mean things; and that God was to be apprehended only by the Mind. The ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> pretend to have received the ſame Law from their <hi>Zoroaſter;</hi> who, in a number of things is ſo like to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Huetius</hi> thinks (not without reaſon) his ſtory was framed out of theſe Books.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And ſhowing mercy unto thouſands.</hi>] To invite their Obedience, he promiſes to be kind unto them and their Poſterity, for <hi>many Generations</hi> (ſo <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> ſignifies) who were loyal and faithful to him. Such is the infinite goodneſs of God, that he delights in ſhowing Mercy, more than in Acts of Severity; there being ſuch a diſproportion between the one and the other, as there is between <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four,</hi> and a <hi>thouſand.</hi> Which made the heavy Puniſhment of <hi>Idolaters</hi> the more reaſonable, becauſe they might have enjoyed ſuch great and long continued Bleſſings, if they would have kept cloſe to their Religion.</p>
               <p>

For God now eſpouſed this Nation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf, (as the Prophets taught them to underſtand it) and therefore all the Idolatry which is forbidden in theſe Commandments, is called <hi>going a whoring</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And keep my Commandments.</hi>] Not only profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be his intirely, but proved it by obſerving his Precepts. Which <hi>keeping</hi> or obſerving of <hi>his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> is mentioned here perhaps, and not
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60246:187"/>any of the following Commandments; becauſe this and the firſt were the principal, upon which the reſt depended: There being no reaſon to mind what he ſaid, if they acknowledged any other God but him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Nante of the LORD thy God in vain.</hi>] By the <hi>Name</hi> of the LORD in Scripture, is meant the LORD himſelf: and to <hi>take</hi> or <hi>lift up</hi> his Name, is to Swear by him. So this word <hi>Naſa</hi> ſometimes ſignifies without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Name, III <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. <hi>Jiſſa</hi> he ſhall <hi>lift up</hi> in that day; which we truly render, <hi>in that day he ſhall ſwear:</hi> which they did then with the Hand lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven. And to take his Name, or ſwear <hi>in vain,</hi> is to ſwear falſly. That's the principal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undoubtedly, that they ſhould not call God to witneſs unto a Lie; promiſing in his Name that which they meant not to perform; or affirming or denying with an Oath, that which they knew not to be true. For ſo the word <hi>Schave</hi> frequently ſignifies in Scripture, <hi>a Lie.</hi> This relates not to their giving a Teſtimony before a Judge upon Oath, (of which he ſpeaks afterward, in a diſtinct Commandment) but to their Intercourſe and Commerce one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For an Oath, ſaith <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> ought to eſtabliſh every thing: and thereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſelves to be as much reſolved concerning that which we ſwear, as we are concerning the Being of God.</p>
               <p>Heathens themſelves accounted an Oath ſo ſacred a thing, that it was capital for a Man to forſwear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as <hi>Hen. Stephanus</hi> (in his <hi>Fontes Juris Civilis, p.</hi> 7.) obſerves out of <hi>Diodorus Siculus, L.</hi> I. and the reaſon he gives of it is this, that ſuch a Man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60246:188"/>two heinous Crimes, by violating his Piety to God, and his Faith to Men, in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, both Jews and Chriſtians, always underſtood ſwearing <hi>lightly,</hi> upon frivolous occaſions, or without any neceſſity, to be here forbidden. <hi>R. Levi,</hi> before-mentioned, ſaith this Precept may be violated <hi>four</hi> ſeveral ways, beſides ſwearing that which we mean not to perform. And <hi>Salvian</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies this to the trivial naming of God and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, upon all occaſions, and ſometimes upon bad occaſions. <hi>Nihil jam penè vanius, quam Chriſti no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſſe videatur,</hi> &amp;c. Every body then ſwearing by Chriſt, he would do this or that, though of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whether he did it or no, or perhaps a thing, which ought not to be done, <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>de Gubern. Dei, p.</hi> 88. <hi>edit. Baluz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that underſtand this of Swearing by falſe Gods (which are called <hi>vain things</hi> in Scripture) do but trifle: that is condemned in the foregoing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; it being a piece of Worſhip to ſwear by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the LORD will not hold him guiltleſs,</hi> &amp;c.] If Men did not puniſh the falſe Swearer, the LORD threatens that he will. And ſo Mankind always thought, as appears by the Law of the XII. <hi>Tables,</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Hen. Stephanus</hi> in the Book quoted above) <hi>Perjurij poena divina, exitium; humana dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> The Divine Puniſhment of Perjury is utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; the Humane Puniſhment is Diſgrace or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. And <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this, that he thought, <hi>Juris jurandi contempta Religio, ſatis Deum ultorem habet:</hi> The contempt of the Religion of an Oath, hath God for a ſufficient Avenger. For
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60246:188"/>an Oath is the ſtrongeſt Bond that is among Men, to bind them to Truth and Fidelity, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>de Oſſic. c.</hi> 31. Witneſs, ſaith he, the XII. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; witneſs our Sacred Forms in taking an Oath; witneſs our Covenants and Leagues, wherein we plight our Faith to Enemies; witneſs the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of our Cenſors, <hi>qui nulla de re diligentius, quam de jurejurando, judicabant,</hi> who judged of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diligently, than of an Oath.</p>
               <p>Nor was the other ſort of <hi>vain</hi> (that is, light and idle) Swearing, without any juſt occaſion, ſuffered to go unpuniſhed: for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 497.) that if any Man was guilty of it, he that heard him Swear was bound to Excommunicate him, (what that was he ſhows in the firſt Book) and if he did not, he was to be Excommunicated himſelf. And there is great reaſon for theſe Civil Laws, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Puniſhment for this Crime; not only becauſe it is a great diſreſpect to God, to uſe his Name ſo lightly, on every trivial occaſion; but becauſe ſuch contempt of the Divine Majeſty, makes Men fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fearful Sin of <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi>] Be mindful of the day, called the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> to make a difference between it and all other days; ſo that it be not employed as they are.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work.</hi>] This is not a Precept requiring Labour; but a Permiſſion to employ ſix days in a Week, about ſuch worldly Buſineſs as they had to do. Which Permiſſion alſo God himſelf abridged, by appointing ſome other Feſtival days; as all Governours may do, upon ſome ſpecial occaſions.</p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:60246:189"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God.</hi>] Appointed by his Authority to be a day of Reſt from your Labours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In it thou ſhalt not do any work.</hi>] Herein the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reſpect to the <hi>Seventh</hi> day conſiſted: on all other days they might work; but on this they were to ceaſe from all manner of work. In which very thing, was the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> of this day; it being hereby ſeparated and diſtinguiſhed from all other days, in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable manner. But then it naturally followed, that having no other work to do, they ſhould call to mind the reaſon why it was thus fanctified, or ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from other days. And the reaſon, ſay the Jews themſelves, was, <hi>That having no other buſineſs, they might faſten in their minds the belief, that the World had a beginning; which is a thred that draws after it all the foundations of the Law;</hi> or the Principles of Religion. They are words of <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides which there was another reaſon, which I ſhall mention preſently. But by this it appears, that the Obſervation of this day, was a Sign, or a Badge, to whom they belonged: A profeſſion that they were all the Servants of Him, who created the Heaven and the Earth, as God himſelf teaches them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand it, XXXI. 13, 17. And that their Minds might be poſſeſſed with this ſenſe, he ordered this Solemn Commemoration of the Creation of the World, to be made once in Seven days. For, as if there had been quicker returns of it, their Secular Buſineſs might have been too much hindred; ſo if it had been delayed longer, this ſenſe might have worn too much out of their minds.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:60246:189"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter,</hi> &amp;c.] They might no more employ others in their worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on this day, than do it themſelves: But their Children, though they underſtood not the reaſon, were to reſt; that in time they might learn this great Truth, that all things were made by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor thy Cattle.</hi>] Their Oxen, and Aſſes, and all other Creatures wont to be employed in their Labours, were to enjoy the benefit of this Reſt as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, V <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. Which was abſolutely neceſſary; it being impoſſible for their Servants to reſt (as is here alſo required) if they were to ſet their Cattle on work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor thy ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi>] No ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who by being Circumciſed, had embraced the Jewiſh Religion. But other ſtrangers might work; who only dwelt among them, having renounced I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, but not taken upon them the Obligation to obſerve their whole Law. Yet if any ſuch Perſon was a Servant to a Jew, his Maſter might not imploy him on the Sabbath day in any work of his; but the Man might work for himſelf, if he pleaſed, being not bound to this Law. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> III. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth.</hi>] There were two reaſons for the Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this day. One was, becauſe God reſted from his Work of Creation on the Seventh day, which is mentioned here; the other was, becauſe he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them reſt from their Labours in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which he mentions in the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> There is no body hath explained both theſe better than <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, More Nevoch. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 31.
<q>There are two different
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:60246:190"/>Cauſes, ſaith he, for this Precept, from two different Effects. For when <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt explained to us the cauſe of this Celebration, in the Promulgation of the X. Commandments, he ſaith it was, becauſe <hi>in ſix days the LORD made Heaven and Earth.</hi> But in the repetition of them, he ſaith, <hi>Remember that thou was a ſervant in</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c. therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> V Deut. 15. The firſt Cauſe, is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Magnificence of this day, as it is ſaid, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the LORD bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſancifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it,</hi> II Gen. 3. This was the effect of that Cauſe, <hi>for in ſix days he made Heaven and Earth,</hi> (this was the reaſon, he means, of the firſt Inſtitution of the Sabbath) but that he gave this Precept of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto <hi>us</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) and commanded us to obſerve it, was from the other Cauſe, which followed the firſt Cauſe, <hi>becauſe we were Servants in</hi> Egypt. All which time we could not ſerve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own Will and Pleaſure, nor had any Reſt, or obſerved a Sabbath: And therefore God gave us this ſpecial Precept of Reſting and Ceſſation from Labours, to joyn together theſe two Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> the belief of the beginning of the World, which preſently ſuggeſts to us the Being of God; and then the memory of Gods Benefits unto us, in giving us Reſt from our intolerable Burdens in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore he bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi>] In the beginning of the World he bleſſed the Seventh day, II <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and now particularly choſe <hi>this</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, for a Sabbath; which he ordered them to obſerve in memory of their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> on that day; as I obſerved XVI. 5, 23. By which he
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60246:190"/>preſerved in their minds, that ſingular Benefit which he had beſtowed upon them:
<q>and moſt manifeſtly (ſaith <hi>Maimonides</hi> in another place, <hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 43.) procured great eaſe to all ſorts of Men, by freeing a <hi>ſeventh</hi> part of their Lives from weariſom Labour. Which hath another Bleſſing in conjunction with it, that it perpetually preſerved and confirmed that moſt precious Hiſtory and Doctrine concerning the Creation of the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi>] In another place they are commanded to <hi>fear</hi> them, XIX <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. and as here the Father is put before the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo there the Mother is put before the Father; to ſhow, (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> takes it, in his Treatiſe called <hi>Memarim, c.</hi> 6.) that we ought not to make any difference between them; but they are both equally to be honoured and reverenced. Which is a Duty of ſuch great concernment, that we are taught by the placing of this Commandment immediately after thoſe which peculiarly relate to God's Worſhip; that next to his Majeſty, our Parents are to be honoured, with that reverence, love, obedience, and mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is due to them. And therefore notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſobedience to them is threatned with death, as well as Apoſtacy from God. Wherein this <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> doth conſiſt, is taught in all Books of Religion: and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath named a great many things wherein the Jews place it, as the Learned Reader may ſee, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 558, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, that this was a Law among the Heathens, mentioned by <hi>Saleucus, Charondas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>That thy days may be long in the Land,</hi> &amp;c.] As diſobedience to Parents is, by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> threatned to be puniſhed with death; ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, long Life (which is the greateſt worldly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) is promiſed to the Obedient; and that in their own Country, which God had peculiarly inriched with abundance of his Bleſſings. Heathens alſo gave the very ſame incouragement, ſaying that ſuch <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be dear to the Gods, both living and dead.</hi> So <hi>Euripides,</hi>

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>] After the Command about the reſpect due to Parents, naturally follows the regard we ought to have to all other Men, who ſpring from them. And the greateſt injury we can do another, is to take away his Life; whereby he is deprived of all the Enjoyments of this World, and Humane Society it ſelf is alſo wounded, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60246:191"/>ſubſiſt if its innocent Members cannot be ſafe. <hi>Innocent,</hi> I ſay, for this Commandment doth not hinder Men from defending themſelves from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, XXII. 2. nor forbids Magiſtrates to puniſh thoſe with death, who commit Crimes worthy of it: for this is to preſerve the Lives of other Men, XXII. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi>] Next to a Man's ſelf, his Wife is nearer to him, than any other Perſon; they two being <hi>one fleſh.</hi> Which makes the injury done to him in her Perſon, a breach of Humane Society next to Murder. Nay, the LXX. place this Commandment before the other, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> Vertuous Woman valuing their Chaſtity more than their Lives; and the Crimes to which meer Pleaſure tempts Men, being more grievous, in the opinion of the great Philoſopher, than thoſe to which they are ſtimulated by anger. <hi>Whoredom</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo forbidden in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Incest;</hi> as Wounding any Man is, as well as Murder: but in theſe X. <hi>Words,</hi> which are a ſhort Abridgment of their Duty, it was ſufficient only to mention the principal things, of every kind, which were hateful to God and injurious to Men.</p>

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy Neighbour.</hi>] As our Neighbour is not to be injured by us in Deeds, ſo not in Words; by giving a falſe Teſtimony againſt him before a Judge; which is the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60246:192"/>chief Sin of this kind. This is both an injury to our Neighbour, and an affront to God; in whoſe place the Judge is, whom we go about to deceive.</p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is forbidden ſo much as the deſigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miſchief to others, in any of the things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. For as all Injuries in word or deed are prohibited in the IV. preceding Commandments: So in this he prohibits thoſe, which are only in the heart, or counſels of Men, but never come to light. And in the enumeration of the things they were not to covet, he begins firſt with that which was laſt mentioned, and ſo backard to the other. For he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours Houſe,</hi> by deſigning to bear <hi>falſe witneſs,</hi> or to commit <hi>theft.</hi> And then follows, thou ſhalt not covet thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>Wife,</hi> by intending to abuſe her, if opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſerved; <hi>nor his Man-ſervant, nor his Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> &amp;c. which are his principal Goods.

                  <hi>Ye have ſeen that I have talked with you from Heaven.</hi>] The apprehenſion of one ſenſe (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, <hi>More Nevoch.

As, <hi>See the word of the LORD,</hi> II <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. that is, hear it, or mark it diligently. Or, the meaning here may be, <hi>You ſaw,</hi> i. e. perceived, by the Thundrings, and Lightnings, and all the reſt of the Tokens of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtatick Preſence,</hi> that it was I who ſpake from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Ye ſhall not make with me.</hi>] The Hebrew Writers here make a pauſe, or full ſtop, as if it were a compleat Sentence. And the meaning is explained in the <hi>Talmud</hi> to be, <hi>Ye ſhall not make the Similitude of the Miniſters, that minister before me above,</hi> as the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, or the Angels, <hi>Ger. Bab.</hi> upon <hi>Avoda Zura.</hi> And ſo <hi>Maimonides,</hi> upon the ſame Subject, It is unlawful to form the Images of the

But if we joyn theſe with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, the ſenſe is the ſame; that as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no other Gods but him, ſo they ſhould not make any Image to repreſent him. To inforce which the word <hi>make</hi> is repeated in the end of the Verſe, whereby greater efficacy is added to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods of ſilver, or gods of gold ſhall ye not make unto you.</hi>] He gives this Caution, leſt by the ſplendour of theſe Metals they ſhould be tempted (being prone to Superſtition and Idolatry) to make ſuch kind of Repreſentations. For by <hi>Gods,</hi> are meant Images to repreſent him; which at the firſt were made very glittering, like the heavenly Bodies; but afterward they proceed to worſhip Images of meer Wood, or Stone.</p>
               <p>The coherence of this, with the foregoing Verſes, is ſomething obſcure; unleſs we obſerve how this is reported in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> puts them in mind, that they <hi>ſaw no Similitude on the day that God ſpake with them in</hi> Horeb, IV. 15. and therefore not to <hi>make them a graven Image, the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of any Figure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the meaning is here, <hi>ye have ſeen that I talked with you from Heaven,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> you heard only a Voice, but ſaw no Similitude of Man, or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) therefore ye ſhall not repreſent me by any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, though never ſo rich and glorious. And thus <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> ſeems to have underſtood it, <hi>de Vita Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, p.</hi> 180. God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> many Divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the chief of which is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and to have becoming Notions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Divine Nature, as tranſcending all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, nay all our thoughts, and like to nothing that we know.

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>An Altar of Earth ſhalt thou make unto me.</hi>] For the better obſervation of the foregoing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, he orders that his Altars ſhould be made as plain and ſimple as might be. Either of Sods and Turfs of Earth (which were eaſily prepared, in moſt places, whilſt they ſtaid in the Wilderneſs) or of rough and unpoliſhed Stone (if they came into rocky places, where no Sods were to be got) that ſo there might be no occaſion to grave any Image upon them. Such Altars <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves were among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romans, in the days of <hi>Numa:</hi> when, as they had no ſumptuous Temples, nor Images, ſo they had only <hi>temeraria de ceſpite altaria,</hi> Altars haſtily hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up of Earth, without any Art, <hi>Apolog. cap.</hi> 25. which <hi>Jamblicus</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

Nay, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:60246:195"/>Scacchus</hi> will have it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them <hi>to make the Earth their Altar;</hi> as the words may be tranſlated out of the Hebrew: which he thus interprets, Thou ſhalt mark out a place upon the bare Ground, and there offer Sacrifice, <hi>Myrothec.</hi> II. <hi>Sacr.

               <p>

Which moved him, not to aboliſh it, but to tranſlate it, from created and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Beings, to his own moſt Adorable Name. Therefore he commanded us, ſaith he, to make him a Sanctuary, (XXV. 8.) and conſecrate an Altar to his Name, and offer him Sacrifices, (for which he alledges this very Text) and on the contrary prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits us to do ſuch things, to any other Being, XXII. 20.

This muſt be the meaning here;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:60246:195"/>becauſe the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was the Memorial of God's Preſence with them, was not yet made. Or elſe, he means the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> before mentioned, which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> thinks may be here pointed at; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe were Rites of Remembrance, whereby the Name of God was commemorated or recorded, and his Covenant with Men teſtified and renewed.

                  <hi>I will come unto thee,</hi> or, <hi>meet with thee.</hi>] Upon which account the Tabernacle of the LORD was called <hi>Ohel Moed,</hi> the Tabernacle of Meeting. Not becauſe of the Peoples meeting there to Worſhip (as is commonly ſuppoſed, when we tranſlate thoſe words <hi>the Tabernacle of the Congregation</hi>) but of God's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there with his People, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves (<hi>p.</hi> 436.) from many plain places of Scripture, XXIX <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 42.

               <p>

The <hi>Gentiles</hi> believed their Gods were preſent, where their Images were worſhipped. But he promiſes to be preſent in all places whatſoever, where he would have his Name celebrated (<hi>i. e.</hi> where he would be worſhipped) though their Sacrifices were offered upon the moſt mean and ſimple Altar.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>If thou wilt make me an Altar of ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.] If it cannot be made without Stones (ſaith <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides, P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nevoch. c.</hi> 45.) take care that the Stones remain in their own natural form, and that they be not poliſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was to avoid Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60246:196"/>for fear they ſhould make any figure with the Tools they imployed, in ſhaping and faſhioning the Stones, after an artificial manner: or ſhould reſerve the pieces of Stone that were paired off, for Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious or Magical uſes. Juſt, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> as he forbids planting a Grove near his Altar, for that was to imitate Idolaters, XVI <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. See IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 15, 16. which plainly ſhows this was the reaſon of this Command.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, theſe Altars were built like thoſe of Turf, on a ſudden, without any Art; only by piling Stones one upon another. Such an Altar <hi>David</hi> built upon a ſpecial occaſion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 25. and after him <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 31, 32. and <hi>Fortunatus Scac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> makes it probable, that it was ſuch an one which <hi>Ezra</hi> built, at their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to their own Country, III. 2, 3. <hi>Myrothec.</hi> II. <hi>Sacr. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeochryſ. c.</hi> 59. where he repreſents the form of ſuch an Altar among the Heathen, out of an ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, <hi>p.</hi> 585. And there is little doubt, I think, that the Altars built by the Patriarchs were of this ſort; particularly that which <hi>Abraham</hi> erected whereon to offer his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> XXII <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. for it was raiſed ſo ſuddenly, that no Art could be imployed about it.</p>
               <p>I omit other Reaſons which the Jews alledge for this Law, for they ſeem to me to be fanciful. And ſhall rather obſerve that <hi>Plato</hi> in his Laws, ordered all things belonging to the Service of God, ſhould be very ſimple and plain, without any Coſt or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament: and therefore forbids Gold, Silver, or Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe they were things too invidious, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and Braſs and Iron he would not have uſed, becauſe they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60246:196"/>of Wars: but one ſingle piece of Wood or Stone ſhould ſerve for an Image, and that made in a days time, <hi>L.</hi> XII. <hi>de Legibus, p.</hi> 955. 56. Edit. <hi>Serran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems difficult alſo to reconcile theſe two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with God's own Ordinance, not long after in the XXVII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Book; where he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> to make him an Altar, neither of <hi>Earth</hi> nor of <hi>Stone,</hi> but of <hi>Shittim-wood,</hi> covered with Braſs, for the uſe of the Tabernacle, where he recorded his Name. But it is to be conſidered, that theſe two Verſes ſpeak only of occaſional Altars (as I may call them) which they might have uſe of, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but after the Tabernacle was erected. Theſe God doth not forbid, when there was a ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them; but he intending there ſhould be no <hi>ſtated</hi> Altar, but that at the Tabernacle, he would have theſe made of unpoliſhed Stone, laid one upon another, that they might be thrown down as ſoon as raiſed; and that they might not draw People from the Tabernacle, nor adminiſter occaſion of Idolatry, by an artificial Workmanſhip and Imagery. Now that there were ſuch Altars raiſed upon certain great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, but not to continue, appears from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory. For XXIV. 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> built one at the Foot of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by God's command it's likely, and of this faſhion. And he gave order for building one of Stone after they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> (XXVII <hi>Deut.</hi> 1, 2, 3.) which <hi>Joſhua</hi> performed, according to this Rule, as is expreſly ſaid VIII <hi>Joſh.</hi> 30, 31. Of this ſort were thoſe of <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> VI <hi>Judg.</hi> 24, 26. XIII. 19. And we read of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars built by <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 17. and by <hi>Saul,</hi> XIV. 35. and <hi>David,</hi> as was before obſerved, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 25. and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> III. 2, 34. beſides
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60246:197"/>the Altar which was in the Tabernacle and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up by ſteps unto my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>] This was moſt ſutable to the ſtate of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to have their Altars low, not lofty. Beſides, he would not have them imitate the Gentiles, who Sacrificed in High Places; imagining their Sacrifices were moſt acceptable, when they were neareſt to Heaven. Whence the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> living in a flat Country, wherein were no Mountains, built Altars of a very great height, which could not be well done by Sods of Earth, or Stones looſely laid together. Nor would God have it done, when he ordered <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes</hi> to make an Altar of Braſs and Wood at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; which it is evident was ſo low, that a Man might ſtand and miniſter there, without being raiſed from the Earth: For it was but <hi>three Cubits</hi> high, (XXVII. 1.) which is leſs by one Cubit than the ordinary ſtature of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not go up by ſteps.</hi>] There were ſteps, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> unto the brazen Altar, which was <hi>ten</hi> Cubits high: And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> expreſly mentions them in the deſcription of his Temple, XLIII. 17. which ſeeming to diſagree with this Command, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters are much concerned to reconcile them. And the fore-named <hi>Fortun. Scacchus c.</hi> 63. contends ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that no Altar was higher than <hi>three</hi> Cubits; and therefore thoſe ſteps mentioned by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did not belong to the Altar, but to the <hi>Baſis</hi> or Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work (as we ſpeak) upon which it ſtood. But this is ſaid without good ground, for we read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar was <hi>ten</hi> Cubits high, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> IV. 1.) at which therefore the Prieſt could not miniſter, without ſome <hi>ſteps,</hi> whereby he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60246:197"/>ſo high, as to be able to lay on the Wood, and the Sacrifice upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By <hi>ſteps</hi> therefore (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit other Conjectures) I underſtand <hi>many ſteps</hi> (which are here forbidden) ſuch as the Gentiles had to go up to their <hi>Bamoth</hi> or High Places; as we ſee by one of the Pyramids in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the high Tower at <hi>Mexico;</hi> to which they aſcended by an Hundred and eighty ſteps. But a very few ſerved for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar; and they were ſo contrived alſo, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Writers tell us, that there was no danger of that which God intended hereby to prevent, in the words following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thy nakedneſs be not diſcovered thereon.</hi>] The Hebrews ſay it was a kind of <hi>Cauſway</hi> or <hi>Bridge</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they went up to the Altar; which roſe by little and little, till they came to the place where they were to ſtand. See <hi>L'Empereur</hi> upon the <hi>Codex Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth, c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. Or elſe the ſteps were ſo broad and ſo little diſtant one from another, and the aſcent thereby made ſo eaſie and equal, that there was no need of lifting up their leggs high, and therefore no danger of diſcovering the lower parts of the Body, (their Thighs, Buttocks, and Secret Parts) which might have been ſeen by thoſe below (had they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended by many large and high ſteps) under ſuch looſe Garments as were worn in thoſe Countries; and thereby the Prieſts might have been expoſed to contempt, and the People moved to laughter, or had bad thoughts excited in them. In ſhort, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, they ſhould not go up many ſteps, far diſtant one from another, ſo that one muſt have taken large ſtrides to aſcend them.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:60246:198"/>
               <p>The Jews ſay, particularly <hi>Maimonides, P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nevoch. c.</hi> 45. that the Worſhippers of <hi>Baal-Peor</hi> were wont to diſcover their <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> that is, their Secret Parts, before him. Which he takes to be the reaſon of this Command; leſt any ſuch thing ſhould happen in God's Preſence: and this was the reaſon alſo of another Law, that the Prieſts ſhould have Breeches made for them, which none of the People wore, in thoſe times, but the Prieſts alone; and that only when they miniſtred. The <hi>Gemara Hieroſolym.</hi> upon the ſtory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> gives a long account of this Impure Worſhip, as <hi>L'Empereur</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon <hi>Codex Middoth, c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. But there is no proof of this from any ancient Author; and the <hi>Babylonian Gemara</hi> gives a different account of the Worſhip of <hi>Peor;</hi> which looks as if the Jews ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to make it ridiculous, as well as filthy. But if there were any ſolid ground for it, it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the cleareſt explication of this place.</p>

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>NOW theſe are the Judgments thou ſhalt ſet before them.</hi>] By <hi>Judgments</hi> are meant ſuch Political Laws which God thought fit to give for the determination of Differences among the People; and that they might be juſtly and peaceably governed. Which, though they were not ſpoken with ſuch Pomp and Majeſty as the X. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, (and much leſs were the Ceremonial Precepts delivered with ſuch ſolemnity) yet the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> believed that they came from the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though ſpoken to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60246:198"/>and not in the audience of all the People; as appears by their ſubmiſſion to theſe, no leſs than to the other Laws. And there was great reaſon for it; it being their own deſire not to hear God's voice any more; but to be inſtructed by <hi>Moſes</hi> what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and they promiſed to obey it, XX. 19.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>If thou buy an Hebrew Servant,</hi> &amp;c.] Or a <hi>Slave.</hi> Some Perſons ſold themſelves by reaſon of Poverty: of which ſort the Hebrews underſtand that Law XXV <hi>Lev.</hi> 39. Others were ſold by the Court of Judgment; which was in caſe of a Theft they had committed; for which, not being able to make Satisfaction unto him that had received the Damage, they were condemned to be his Servants. Of theſe they interpret this place, and XV <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. But this Sale, they ſay, did not extend to both Sexes; for a Woman was not to be ſold for Theft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſeventh year he ſhall go out free for nothing.</hi>] If the Damage was ſo great, that his ſix years Service had not ſatisfied for it, yet he was not to be kept lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And his Servitude alſo might end ſooner, by Manumiſſion, or Redemption, or the Death of his Maſter, if he were a Gentile or a Proſelyte. Nay, if he were an Hebrew, his Death put an end to it, in caſe he left no Son. And his Maſter alſo was bound to maintain his Wife and Children (if he had any) all this time, giving them Food, Raiment, and a Dwelling, though they were not to be his Servants. See Mr. <hi>Selden L.</hi> VI. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that he ſets this Law in the firſt place, becauſe <hi>Mercy,</hi> next to <hi>Piety,</hi> is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertue: and God would have his People, ſaith <hi>R. Levi Barzelonita,</hi> adorned with, and full of the nobleſt qualities, which are Benignity and Mercy.</p>

               <p>This Year of Releaſe alſo being a Sacred Year; the whole Land being Holy to the LORD, ſo that no Man might challenge any Right or Propriety in it, to ſow his Field, or reap that which grew of it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was Sacriledge for any Maſter to keep a Servant from his Freedom, when the Year came, which was the <hi>LORD's Releaſe,</hi> as we read expreſly XXV <hi>Lev.</hi> and XV <hi>Deut.</hi> Whence it was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Jews were ſo prophane, as to break this Law, and not give their Servants liberty, (as we read in the XXXIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) God puniſhed them with a Captivity of LXX. years, in which the Land lay waſte, till it had fulfilled the Years of Reſt which they would not obſerve; as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath truly noted, <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XXVI. latter end.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>If he come in by himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, a ſingle Man, without a Wife; ſo he was to depart. But if he was a married Man when he was ſold; as the Maſter was not to let his Wife and Children want Food, and Raiment, and Habitation, while he continued his Slave; ſo when he was free, he was not to meddle with them, or detain them from their Father and Husband, XXV <hi>Lev.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>If his Maſter have given him a Wife.</hi>] Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Servant as this, who was ſold by the Court of Judgment, his Maſter might give a Gentile-Maid to Wife, (and no other Hebrew but ſuch as he, might marry a Gentile) that he might beget Children of her, who were to be the Maſters Servants or Slaves for ever. The Hebrew Doctors ſay the Maſter could not do this, unleſs ſuch a Servant had a lawful Wife and Children before of his own, who were not to be kept from him; but he might beget Children for himſelf, as well as for his Maſter; who could not
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60246:199"/>impoſe upon him more than one Maid-ſervant, to be his Wife. He that ſold himſelf alſo, was not ſubject to this Law. But as his Maſter could not impoſe a Wife of this ſort upon him; ſo neither was he bound, when the Servant went free, to beſtow any Gift up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: which was due only to him, that was ſold by the Court for Theft, (XV <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.) to whom the ancient Jews ſay he was to give thirty ſhekels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhe have born him Sons or Daughters.</hi>] During his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Wife and Children ſhall be his Maſters,</hi> &amp;c.] For the Wife was a Slave as well as himſelf, when he married her. And ſhe was given to Wife, meerly that he might beget Slaves of her. Who therefore continued with the Maſter, as well as their Mother, when the Man had his Liberty: for they were not ſo much his, as his Maſters Goods; who had ſuch a power over them, that he might Circumciſe them, as he did his own Children, without their conſent. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> VI. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 7. and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xore Hebr. L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And if the Servant ſhall plainly ſay.</hi>] In the Hebrew the words are, <hi>ſaying, ſhall ſay;</hi> i.e. Stand in it (as we ſpeak) and ſtedfaſtly reſolve, by ſaying it, not in a fit, but conſtantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I love my Maſter, my Wife and my Children,</hi> &amp;c.] If his love to ſuch a Wife and Children, who were not properly his own, was greater than his Love to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; which made him ſtill deſire their Company, and chooſe to ſtay with his Maſter, who had been ſo good to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>His Maſter ſhall bring him to the Judges.</hi>] That it might appear he was not fraudulently or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly detained againſt the Law, but with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or rather at his deſire.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:60246:200"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall alſo bring him to the door, or the door-poſt.</hi>] After the Caſe had been heard, and the Judges had given Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his Maſter ſhall bore his ear through with an awl.</hi>] In token that he was now affixed to his Houſe, and might not ſo much as ſtep over the Threſhold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, but be obedient to his will for ever. This is to be underſtood only of one that was ſold by the Court; not of him that ſold himſelf. And though the Hebrews take this to have been a mark of Infamy, ſet upon a Man who choſe Servitude before Liberty; yet it being choſen out of love to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I cannot think that they intended by this Act to diſgrace him. But look upon it only as a ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of him to his Maſter's Service; which was done, it is likely, in the preſence of the Judges. This Cuſtom of boring the Ears of Slaves, laſted a long time after this in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſhows out of <hi>Juvenal Sat.</hi> 1. and <hi>Petronius L.</hi> III, <hi>Hierozoic. c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And if a man ſell his daughter, to be a maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant.</hi>] Beſides the two former ſorts of Perſons ſold to be Servants, there was a third here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is thus expounded by the Hebrews: That ſhe was to be a Virgin, under Age; that is, leſs then XII. years old and a day. For if ſhe was more than that, it was not lawful for him to ſell her: and when ſhe came to be of Age, it put an end to her Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as well as the Year of Jubilee did, or Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Death of her Maſter. Beſides, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:60246:200"/>might not ſell her, unleſs he were reduced to extream Poverty. If he did, without ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was forced by the Court of Judgment to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem her. And ſhe was not to be ſold neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were ſome hope, her Maſter or his Son might take her to Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſhall not go out as the men-ſervants do.</hi>] There were other, and better Conditions for her, than for the Servant mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. particularly, her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter could not marry her to any Body, but to himſelf or his Son.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>If ſhe pleaſe not her Maſter, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed her to himſelf.</hi>] This ſhows ſhe was ſold to him, upon the preſumption he would take her for his Wife; and there was ſuch a previous agreement about this, that there needed no other Eſpouſals: But if, after this, he changed his mind, and did not like her enough to make her his Wiſe; then God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains as follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſhall he let her be redeemed.</hi>] She was to ſerve her Maſter ſix years, if ſhe was ſold for ſo long; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe was redeemed (which her Maſter is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not to refuſe) or manumitted; or ſet free by the Year of <hi>Jubilee;</hi> or by the Death of her Maſter; or (which was peculiar in this caſe) the ſigns of her being ripe for Marriage appeared. See <hi>Selden</hi> in the place before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſell her to a ſtrange Nation he ſhall have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>] No Man had power to ſell an Hebrew Servant to one of another Nation: And therefore by a <hi>ſtrange People</hi> (as the word is here in the Hebrew) muſt be meant an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> of another family, that was not of her Kindred, nor had any right of Redemption.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>If he hath betrothed her to his Son.</hi>] Which was expected from him, if he did not think fit to marry her himſelf, <hi>he ſhall deal with her after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of daughters.</hi> If the word <hi>he</hi> relate to the Father, the meaning is, he ſhall give her a Portion, as if ſhe were his own Daughter. If it relate to the Son, the meaning is, he ſhall treat her like a Wife.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>If he take him another wife, her food,</hi> &amp;c.] If after the Son had married her, he took another Wife beſides, he was ſtill to perform to this, all thoſe things that belong to a Wife, <hi>viz.</hi> give her Food, and Raiment, and at certain times (which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Law in ſome Countries) cohabit with her as her Husband. From this place, the Hebrews have made a general Rule, that theſe three things are owing to all Wives from their Husbands, <hi>viz.</hi> Alimony, Clothes, and the Conjugal Duty. For howſoever the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> underſtand the laſt word, the Hebrews generally take it, for that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>due Benevolence,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 3.

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>But if a man come preſumptuouſly.</hi>] The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> rightly tranſlates it <hi>induſtriouſly,</hi> or with deſign to kill him; for it is oppoſed to ignorance. The Hebrew word alſo carries in it a ſignification of <hi>boiling anger;</hi> which doth not alter the Caſe: For if a Man in the height of his Rage, reſolved to kill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and laid wait for him to execute his Deſign, it was juſtly judged to be wilful Murder, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60246:202"/>with Death. Which was far more equal than <hi>Plato</hi>'s Law, That ſuch a Man ſhould only be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>three</hi> years; as he, that on a ſudden, killed a Man in his Anger, only for two, <hi>L.</hi> IX. <hi>de Legibus, p.</hi> 867.</p>

He was bound to pay for the Cure of the former, but not of the latter. And if after a Man was cured, he fell ill again, he that ſtruck him was not bound to take care of his Cure.</p>
               <p>The ſame Proviſion is made in the Civil Law, as <hi>L'Empereur</hi> notes, which perfectly agrees with this Conſtitution of <hi>Moſes—Judex computat mercedes medicis praeſtitas, caeteráque impendia, quae in curatione facta ſunt: Praeterea operas quibus caruit, aut cariturus est ob id, quod inutilis factus eſt.</hi>

So that this whole Law is to be underſtood of an <hi>Abortion;</hi> and according to the condition of the <hi>Abortive</hi> (not the Life or Death of the Mother) ſo the Puniſhment was to be inflicted.

But after all, there ſeems to be a great deal of reaſon, at leaſt in many Caſes, to admit of a Compenſation. As in that mentioned by <hi>Diodorus Siculus, L.</hi> XII. where the one-eyed Man complained of this Law (which was among the Heathen) as too rigid; for if he loſt the other Eye, he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more than the Man whom he injured, who had ſtill one Eye left. Upon ſuch Conſiderations <hi>Phavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> argues againſt this Law, which was one of the XII. Tables, as not poſſible to be juſtly executed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very Letter of it. For the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Body, is far more valuable to one Man, than it is to another. For inſtance; the right Hand of a Scribe, or a Painter, cannot be ſo well ſpared as the right Hand of a Singer. And therefore, the Law of the XII. Tables, concerning <hi>Taliones</hi> (Like for Like) was with this Exception, <hi>Ni cum eo pacit.</hi> That is, if he who had put out a Man's Eye, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the uſe of any other Member, would not come to an Agreement, <hi>de talione redimenda,</hi> to make him Satisfaction, and redeem the Puniſhment, he was to ſuffer in the very ſame kind. So <hi>Sex. Caecilius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it in <hi>Aulus Gellius, L.</hi> XX. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>If a man ſmite the eye of his ſervant, or the eye of his maid,</hi> &amp;c.] It is but reaſon that this ſhould extend to all Servants, though of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not meerly to thoſe who were Jews.

P. III. c. 41. And therefore the common Reſolution of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, is very cruel, That Gentile Servants (whom they call <hi>Canaanites</hi>) who were not Circumciſed, ſhould not have the benefit of this Law.

And the Hebrew Doctors ſay, that if a Man eat ſo much as the Bigneſs of an Olive of this Fleſh, he was to be Scourged. By this means both he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were admoniſhed to be more careful and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: And God alſo declared how heinous the Crime of Murder is; the Puniſhment of which, in ſome ſort, reached even unto Beaſts: which were therefore alſo ſtoned, when they had killed a Man, that no more might be in danger of their Lives by them. Some think its Fleſh therefore could not be eaten, becauſe, being ſtoned, it was a Carcaſe whoſe Blood was in it. But <hi>Maimonides</hi> anſwers to this (in his Treatiſe of <hi>forbidden Meats</hi>) that the Scope of the Law is, that as ſoon as the Sentence for its being ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was pronounced, it became unclean. Nay, if a Man, to prevent this Sentence, killed it after a legal manner, no Man might eat a Bit of it. And when
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60246:208"/>it was ſtoned, the Fleſh was neither ſold, nor given to the Gentiles, nor to the Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Bochart</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 40.</p>

                  <hi>But the owner ſhall be quit.</hi>] The loſs of his Ox was all his Puniſhment. And if the Ox did not kill the Man, but only wounded him, in that caſe the Owner was obliged to make him ſuch a Compenſation as the Judges thought equal, and to take care the like hapned not again.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>But if the Ox were wont to puſh in time paſt, and it hath been teſtified to him,</hi> &amp;c.] In the former caſe, the Owner was only puniſhed with the loſs of his Ox; it being the firſt time that it had been known to puſh. But if the Ox had formerly been known to be ſo unruly, and he had been told of it, and yet did not take care to prevent further miſchief, then he, as well as the Ox, were to be put to death. The Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Doctors indeed have ſoftned this by divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: As <hi>first,</hi> they ſay it was to be proved that the Ox had puſhed upon <hi>three</hi> ſeveral days: for though it appeared he puſhed a great many times in one day, it would not make the Man liable. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it was to be teſtified not only to the Owner,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:60246:208"/>but before the Magiſtrate, that he had puſhed ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> they interpret the laſt words of this Verſe, <hi>(the Owner alſo ſhall be put to death)</hi> of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Hand of Heaven: that is, they leave him to God. See <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 40. But though <hi>Abarbinel</hi> propound this as the opinion of their Wiſe men, yet he was ſenſible of its abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. For he confeſſes that God doth decree the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death ſhould be executed upon the Owner of the Ox: only he thinks that he remits ſomething of the ſtrictneſs of it in the next Verſe. And there are <hi>three</hi> Caſes here mentioned relating to this matter: One in the foregoing Verſe, where the Ox is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſtoned. Another in this, where the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is alſo made liable to be put to death: And a third in the next Verſe, where a Pecuniary Mulct is only ſet upon him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>If there be laid upon him a ſum of money, then he ſhall give it for the ranſome of his life.</hi>] By this it appears there might be a Caſe, wherein the Owner of the Ox ſhould not be put to death, but only be fined, though the Ox had been wont to puſh, and he was told of it. And the Interpretation of this, and the foregoing Law, which is given by <hi>Conſtantine L'Empereur</hi> is not unreaſonable upon <hi>Bava kama, c.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5.) Either the knowledge which the owner had of the ill Conditions of his Ox was certain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and his careleſneſs in preventing the Miſchief he was wont to do was greater or leſſer; and the Friends of him that was killed preſſed the ſtricteſt Juſtice, or were content to remit it. In the former ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (if the knowledge was certain, the careleſneſs very groſs, and the Friends were ſtrict in the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) he was puniſhed with death: but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:60246:209"/>he was puniſhed only by ſetting a Fine upon him. Certain it is, that the foregoing Law might prove too rigorous in many caſes (as if the Ox puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being provoked; or broke looſe when he was tied up; or was let go by the negligence of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and therefore God permitted the Judges to accept of a Ranſom, as they ſaw cauſe, which was to be paid according as the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> thought meet. So <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever is laid upon him.</hi>] He was to ſubmit to the Fine, whatſoever it was: and it was given to the Heirs of him that was killed. If a Man's Wife was killed, the Jews ſay, it was given to the Heirs of her Father's Family, and not to her Husband.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>Whether he have gored a ſon, or have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a daughter,</hi> &amp;c.] Becauſe what was ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 29. of killing <hi>a Man or a Woman,</hi> might have been reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Father or Mother of a Family, whoſe loſs was greateſt, and their lives moſt precious: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame Law is here extended to the Children: yet both <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Onkelos</hi> conſine it to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> as if all Mankind beſides were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. See <hi>Bochartus</hi> in the place above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>If an Ox ſhall puſh a man-ſervant or a maid-ſervant,</hi> &amp;c.] Whether the Servant was of greater or leſſer value, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, the payment of <hi>thirty ſhekels</hi> (and the loſs of the Ox) half the price of a Free-man, who was eſtimated, he ſaith, at <hi>ſixty ſhekels, More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 40. He adds in another place (in his Treatiſe of <hi>Pecuniary Mulcts</hi>) that the Owner was not bound to pay this Ranſom, unleſs the Ox killed the Man out of his own Ground. For if he was killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60246:209"/>in the Owners Ground, the Ox indeed was ſtoned, but no Ranſom was paid. Divers other caſes he mentions in that Book, as <hi>L'Empereur</hi> obſerves upon <hi>Bava kama, p.</hi> 85. where he takes notice that <hi>Solon</hi> himſelf wrote <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>And if a man ſhall open a pit,</hi> &amp;c.] In the Street, or publick High-way, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it. For if he opened or digged a Pit in his own Ground, he was not concerned in this Law, though another Man's Beaſt fell into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And not cover it.</hi>] If he did cover it convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though in time the Cover grew rotten, and a Beaſt fell into it, he was not bound to make it good, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> reſolves the Caſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>The owner of the pit ſhall make it good,</hi> &amp;c.] There were ſo many Caſes aroſe upon this Law, that it is not eaſie to number them. <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath amaſſed together abundance belonging to this matter, with wonderful accuracy, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves; who hath tranſcribed a great many of them, in his <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 40. <hi>p.</hi> 391, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>If one mans Ox hurt anothers that he die.</hi>] Which equally belongs to all other Cattle, as <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> obſerves; for the Law mentions <hi>an Ox</hi> only for example ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall ſell the live Ox and divide the money,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the Ox that was killed, was worth as much more as the other; yet ſatisfaction was to be made only out of the live Ox, which did the miſchief, as the ſame <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves, who hath ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon this Law, as may be ſeen in the fore-named Book of <hi>Bochart's, p.</hi> 393. But it might ſo happen,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60246:210"/>that the Ox which was killed was of little value, and the live Ox worth many pound: in which caſe it ſeems ſo unreaſonable, the Man whoſe loſs was ſmall, ſhould be a great gainer by the Sale of the Ox which did the miſchief, that the Jewiſh Lawyers reſolve the meaning of this Law is, the Man whoſe Ox was killed, ſhould receive half the Damage he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained; as <hi>L'Empereur</hi> obſerves upon <hi>Bava kama, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>Or if it be known that the Ox hath uſed to puſh,</hi> &amp;c.] There is a great difference between what is done caſually, and what is done conſtantly. The former Verſe ſpeaks of the hurt done by a Beaſt that was not wont to puſh; and this, of the hurt done by one that was notoriouſly miſchievous: And accordingly greater Damages were given in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, than in the former. And by this general Rule the Jews regulated all other Caſes: making thoſe Miſchiefs, that were done. by Beaſts which were wont to hurt, or were of a hurtful Nature, to be puniſhed above as much more, than the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by a Creature that was not wont to hurt, or with a part of his Body, which uſes not to hurt.

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>IF a man ſhall ſteal an Ox, or a Sheep, and kill it, or ſell it.</hi>] Before the Theft was diſcovered to be done by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall reſtore five Oxen for an Ox, and four Sheep for a Sheep.</hi>] There is a ſmaller Satisfaction required in other things, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and here is alſo a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſervable between the ſtealing of an Ox and of a Sheep. The reaſon of both was this; that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Goods, Garments, Jewels, which Men keep in their Houſes, within Towns and Cities, are better guarded, and not ſo eaſily ſtoln as Cattle in the Field: and of Cattle in the Field, an Ox was more eaſie to be ſtoln than a Sheep: For Sheep feeding in Flocks, may be all in view of the Shepherd; but Oxen feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcattered one from another, are not ſo eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept by the Netherd. Thus <hi>Maimonides More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 41. But the true reaſon of the difference between an Ox and a Sheep ſeems to be, That an Ox was of greater value, and likewiſe uſeful to more purpoſes in Husbandry, (as ploughing, carrying in, and treading out the Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which made the Puniſhment of ſtealing an Ox, greater than that of ſtealing a Sheep. Yet there was a difference between a Thief, who came and confeſſed his Sin of his own accord; and him that ſtood out till he was apprehended and convicted of it: For in the former caſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to require only the Reſtitution of that which was ſtoln, with the addition of a fifth part of the value, and a Sacriſice, VI <hi>Lev.</hi> 4, 5. All this is far more equal than <hi>Plato</hi>'s Conſtitutions, which for all Thefts require the ſame Puniſhment,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60246:211"/>which was paying double; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And be ſmitten that he die,</hi> &amp;c.] The Maſter of the Houſe might kill the Robber in this caſe; becauſe it might well be thought he intended to kill him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than loſe his booty. The Law of the XII. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles allowed this, as <hi>A.

               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall be ſold for his theft.</hi>] For ſix years. But the Hebrew Doctors have many molliſications of this Law: For they ſay, a Woman was not to be ſold; nor a Man, but for the principal Sum. For <hi>double,</hi> or <hi>four</hi> or <hi>ſivefold,</hi> he was not to be ſold; but have credit for it, till he was able to pay. And he was
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60246:211"/>not to be ſold, who rob'd a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> nor if he had ſtoln leſs than he was worth, when ſold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many other, which ſo mitigate, that they almoſt abrogate it. But the Law of the XII. Tables thought it reaſon, a Thief ſhould be delivered to him whom he rob'd, to be his Slave, as <hi>A. Gellius</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> XX. <hi>c.</hi> 1. See <hi>Bochart. Hicrozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>If it be certainly found in his hand alive,</hi> &amp;c.] There was a great difference between Killing or Selling after the ſtealth; and having theſe Cattle ſound alive with him. In the former caſe he was puniſhed four or ſive-fold, <hi>v.</hi> 1. but in this only dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Becauſe the former concealed his Theft with more induſtry, and left leſs hope of diſcovery and reſtitution than in the latter, as <hi>Bochart</hi> there obſerves. Where he alſo takes notice of the like Law at <hi>Athens,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and by <hi>A. Gellius, L.</hi> XI. <hi>c.</hi> 18. But the Hebrews here alſo have their Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and will not have this extended to Women, Children, and Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall reſtore double.</hi>] In caſe he did not confeſs the Fact himſelf, but was otherwiſe ſound out. For if he did accuſe himſelf, and had neither ſold nor kill'd that which he ſtole, he was not to reſtore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He that ſtole from another Thief, was not bound, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks, to reſtore double. But in caſe a Thief kill'd what he had ſtoln, and after that conſecrated it to God, he was obliged notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to reſtore fourfold: though if he conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it before he kill'd or ſold it, only to reſtore double. For though the Sanctification of a thing, after the Sin was committed, did not take away the guilt: yet before he aggravated his Fault by Killing or Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what he ſtole, the Sanctification leſſened the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>If fire break out,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew word properly imports that which breaks out of it ſelf (as <hi>R. Levi Barzelonita</hi> obſerves) ſo that the meaning of this Law is, that though a Man kindle a fire within his own bounds, and it ſpread further to the damage of his Neighbour, he ſhall be guilty, though he had no hand in putting the fire to the Stacks of Corn which were burnt by it; becauſe he ſhould have lookt better after it, when he had kindled it. For every Man, ſaith he, is bound to watch the fire that he kindles, leſt it do miſchief; it being its nature to break out, and catch hold of any thing that is near it. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ordains (in the place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned upon the former Verſe) that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. if a Man ſet fire to any combuſtible matter, and do not take care his Neighbour receive no harm by it, he ſhall pay ſuch Damages as the Magiſtrates judges juſt. But here the Jewiſh Lawyers conſider, at what diſtance the fire was kindled; and reſolve, that if there was a Fence of four Cubits high, or a publick High-way, or a River, between the Fire and the Field, or Stack of Corn that was burnt, the Man that kindled it was free. See <hi>Bava kama, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4, 5. and <hi>L'Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>If a man ſhall deliver unto his neighbour money, or ſtuff to keep,</hi> &amp;c.] The Equity of the Law contained in this and the following Verſe, is very well explained by <hi>Maimonides; P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 42. <hi>More Nevoch.</hi> He that takes a Neighbour's Goods or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to keep for nothing, and hath no profit thereby, doth a kindneſs to his Neighbour, and therefore is not to bear the loſs of them; which muſt fall upon the Owner himſelf. But he that deſires to be the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60246:213"/>keeper of his Goods, and receives a benefit by the uſe of them, or is paid for his care, muſt make them good if they be ſtoln. Or if the owner and the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per equally partake of the profit, they muſt equally bear the loſs. <hi>R. Levi Barzilonita</hi> interprets this place of that which a Man takes into his cuſtody, <hi>chinnam</hi> (as his word is) <hi>gratis,</hi> as we ſpeak, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reward for his care in keeping it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Shall be brought to the Judges.</hi>] The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Judges were called <hi>Elohim,</hi> Gods.

               <p>
                  <hi>Which another challengeth to himſelf.</hi>] There is great variety in the Tranſlation of theſe words, (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhows <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 12.) but, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ours, the meaning is, When a Man affirms that he either depoſited ſuch things with his Neighbour, or lent them to him, or that he took them, (as <hi>R. Levi Barzelonita</hi> interprets it, <hi>Praecept.</hi> LIV.) both Parties were to be brought before the Judge;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60246:213"/>that he might examine where the Right lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall pay double unto his Neighbour.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> He who pretended to have depoſited the Goods (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) was to pay double if he brought an unjuſt Action againſt his Neighbour; or he with whom the Goods were depoſited was to pay it, if it appeared he had dealt fraudulently: But if it were found, that the Goods were loſt by meer chance, he was not bound to pay any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimonides</hi> explains it thus, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves in the place now mentioned) when a Man brings an Action againſt another, about ſuch things as are here mentioned, and the Defendant confeſſes part of the Charge, but denies the reſt; he was to reſtore as far as he confeſſed; but for the other which he did not confeſs, he was to be put upon his Oath. Or if he denied the whole, and be that brought the Action had but one Witneſs againſt him, he was to purge himſelf by an Oath: For by the Law, no Man was compelled to clear himſelf by an Oath, but in <hi>three</hi> Caſes, of which this was one, when a Man was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by one Witneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>If a man deliver unto his neighbour an aſs, or an ox, or a ſheep, or any beaſt to keep,</hi> &amp;c.] If he lend any of theſe things to his Neighbour upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſiderations, or let them for hire; and his Neighbour affirms that they died, or were hurt, or driven away by Enemies, who carried them Captive; but there was no Witneſs of any of theſe Allegations, then the Cauſe was to be brought before the Judge to find out the Truth, in the manner following:</p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:60246:214"/>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Then ſhall an oath of the LORD be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both,</hi> &amp;c.] If there was no other way to diſcover the Truth, then he to whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, was to purge himſelf by an Oath, that he had not killed the Beaſt, nor done any thing to hurt it: and the Owner was to trouble him no further; nor was he bound to make any Satisfaction: Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he had uſed theſe Goods according to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them: for if he had imployed them contrary to their Contract, then he was bound to make them good to the Owner, of whom they were borrowed or hired. If he refuſed to take the Oath, he was pronounced guilty; and Reſtitution was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be made out of his Goods. But there were ſome temperaments of this Law; for every Man was not admitted to purge himſelf by an Oath. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; he that was of ſo bad a Reputation, that they had a ſuſpicion he would not ſtick to Perjure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was not admitted to be adjured; no, though he that brought the Action required it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 520.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And if it be ſtoln from him.</hi>] Through his negligence, who was intruſted with it,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall make reſtitution to the owner thereof.</hi>] Becauſe he was bound to have lookt better after it; by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wages for his care and pains in keeping it (as ſome interpret) or ingaging to make it good, if he did not take the ſame Care of it, as if it had been his own.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>If it were torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] If he could produce any part of it, as an evidence that it was torn, and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reſcue it, he was not to make it good. But here the Hebrew Doctors make many Exceptions:
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60246:214"/>For they would have him make good what was torn by one Wolf alone; becauſe they think he might have been able to defend the Cattle againſt one, though not againſt many. If alſo he put the Oxen or Sheep into a Paſture, wont to be infeſted with wild Beaſts or Thieves; or if he did not call in the help of his Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in theſe, and ſuch like caſes, he was to make good that which was torn, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> reports their Judgment. See <hi>Bochart. Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>If a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt or die.</hi>] This the Hebrew Doctors think concerns ſuch things as were lent to another out of kindneſs, without any conſideration for the uſe of them. About which, if there aroſe any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie by reaſon of ſome maim that it received, or its death, it was to be determined by the Rule fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The owner thereof being not with it, he ſhall ſurely make it good.</hi>] Theſe words, and thoſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 15th Verſe, <hi>(but if the owner be with it, he ſhall not make it good)</hi> ſeem to ſignifie, that if the Owner was with the thing that was lent, at the time of its hurt or death, it was to be preſumed he would do his beſt to preſerve it, and ſee it was not ill uſed, and ſo muſt bear the loſs: But if he was not preſent at that time, then the contrary was preſumed, that the borrower was in fault, and therefore bound to make it good. Which, though it may ſeem hard, was but neceſſary to make Men careful, and do their beſt to preſerve what was lent them in pure kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> (<hi>Praecept.</hi> LVI.) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it quite another way, in this manner; That if the Owner was with it, at the time it was borrowed,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60246:215"/>though not preſent at the time of its hurt or death, the borrower was free: but if the Owner was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the time of the hurt or death, but not at the time of lending, he was bound to make it good. For <hi>the matter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>depends upon the beginning of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>If it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.</hi>] Some make the Hebrew word <hi>Sachir</hi> (which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>hired thing</hi>) to relate unto the Perſon; <hi>If he be a Mercenary; i. e.</hi> the Man who lends, agrees to let the borrower have it, at a certain price, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is the ſame, in effect, with the ſenſe of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, which makes this word relate to the thing it ſelf: which, if it were borrowed with a Condition to pay ſo much for the uſe of it as the Lender de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, then the Man who hired it was not bound to make it good, whether the Owner were preſent, or not, when it was hurt or died. But the Owner was to run the hazard, becauſe of the hire which he received for the uſe of the thing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>If a man intice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her.</hi>] Whoſoever lay with ſuch a Maid in the City, was thought to have been an <hi>inticer</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (unleſs Witneſſes came and proved that he forced her) becauſe it might be well ſuppoſed her Voice would have been heard, if ſhe had cried out upon the Force in the City. But if he lay with her in the Field, where no Body could hear, it was preſumed to be a Rape. Thus <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and other Hebrew Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall ſurely endow her, to be his wife.</hi>] This Law doth not ſay, as the Old Tranſlation hath it, <hi>he ſhall ondow her, and take her to be his Wife;</hi> but only, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow her to be his Wife:</hi> that is, give her ſuch a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60246:215"/>that ſhe might be his lawful Wife. So the ſame Hebrew Doctors underſtand it; who will not have it to be a Command that he ſhould marry her (though that was beſt) but only that he ſhould make Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for taking away her Virginity; which was, by paying ſo much, in the nature of a Dowry, as would render her fit to be his Wife, if both of them could agree. Yet ſo, that if either he, or ſhe, or her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed (for it was in the power of any of theſe, as they ſay, to hinder the Marriage) he paid this Mulct, as the Dowry of a Virgin, to her Father.

But ſuch wicked Wretches did a world of other Miſchief, and therefore were to be put to death, whether they were Men or Women. The Scripture indeed mentions a <hi>Witch</hi> only (ſaith the <hi>Gemara</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrim, c.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 10.) becauſe for the moſt part, they were Women, who were addicted to Magick. So <hi>Maimonides</hi> alſo, becauſe the greater part of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Works are performed by Women; therefore the Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer MECHAS SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHA, a Witch to live; P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 37. <hi>More Nevochim.</hi> Where he diſcourſes of the ſorts of Witchcraft: and in general affirms, that there were no Magical Works performed, without reſpect to the Stars. For ſuch People held that every Plant had its Star, and ſo had every Animal, and all Metals. For Example; they ſaid,
<q>Pluck ſuch a Leaf, or ſuch an Herb when the Sun, or any other Planet is in ſuch a place; let ſuch a Metal be melted under ſuch a Conſtellation, or ſuch a Conſtitution of the Moon; and then ſay ſuch and ſuch words, and let a Fume be made with ſuch Herbs or Leaves, and that in ſuch or ſuch a form, and then this or that will follow. This was their Doctrine, and ſuch Works as theſe were the <hi>peculiar worſhip of the Stars,</hi> who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, they fancied, with ſuch Actions, Words, or Fumes, and for the ſake of them would do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was deſired.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:60246:216"/>
               <p>All this, he ſaith, he took out of their Books then extant; from which he concludes, That the Scope of the Law being, that all Idolatry ſhould be taken out of the World, and that no vertue ſhould be aſcribed to any Star, of doing good or hurt to Men, (which opinion led Men to their worſhip) it neceſſarily followed, that all <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Wizards</hi> ſhould be put to death, becauſe they were Idolaters; though after a peculiar and different way from that, wherein the Vulgar worſhipped Idols. And he thinks that a <hi>Witch</hi> is rather mentioned than a <hi>Wizard,</hi> (though both intended) becauſe Men are naturally more tender towards the Female Sex, and apt to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them: and therefore it is as if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt kill even a Woman that is guilty of this Crime.</hi> But afterward, XX <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. he commands both Men and Women to be ſtoned.</p>
               <p>Others of the Hebrew Doctors (particularly <hi>R. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi Barzelonita</hi>) give this Reaſon why <hi>Witches</hi> were not to live,
<q>Becauſe they directly thwarted God moſt bleſſed, who made all things when he created them, for ſuch and ſuch purpoſes: which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and by devices of their own, made to ſerve other ends, which God never deſigned; <hi>Praecept.</hi> LXII.</q> But this they could not do without the help of Evil Spirits; and therefore their Crime conſiſted in entering into a Familiarity and a League with them, whoſe aſſiſtance upon ſuch occaſion they invoked: which was, in effect, a renouncing of God.</p>
               <p>This was an Impiety which had overſpread the whole World, eſpecially the Eaſtern parts of it. And as for the <hi>Romans,</hi> we find a Law, as old as the XII. Tables, againſt Witchcraft; <hi>Apud nos in duodecine

The firſt of which [<hi>not to vex a ſtranger</hi>] the Hebrews will have to conſiſt in not upbraiding him with his former ſtate of Heatheniſm, nor giving him any approbrious words: as ſaying, <hi>remember what thou wast; or what thy father did.</hi> And this was neither to be done to a Proſelyte of Juſtice, nor to a Proſelyte of the Gate, as far as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> could judge of their opinion herein, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 4. The ſecond [<hi>not to oppreſs him</hi>] conſiſted in not uſing him hardly, in their dealings with him; by making him pay, for inſtance, for any thing, more than it was worth. Which, the ſame Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> VI. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 690.) thinks, the Hebrews were of opinion, belonged only to their uſage of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes of Juſtice, who were perfectly in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But this is very unreaſonable: for (as <hi>R.

Which God took care they ſhould not be, becauſe they were more helpleſs than other Men, and had fewer Friends. Which is the reaſon that this
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60246:218"/>Precept (as the Jews themſelves have computed) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in <hi>one and twenty</hi> places. See particularly XXIII. 9. XIX. <hi>Lev.</hi> 33.</p>

The Law forbad them to contract to receive back again, any Sum of Money more than they lent. But it was further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by their Wiſe men, that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Gift before hand, to induce them to lend: nor any thing afterward by way of Gratuity, or to expreſs their Thankfulneſs.

But many of them (See him <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 9.) will have another Precept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this, That they Blaſpheme not the Name of the moſt High.

               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer the firſt of thy ripe fruit,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrews will have this to be a direction, for the bringing unto God, in due order, thoſe things which were to be offered to him. As firſt the <hi>Trumah;</hi> which was the firſt Oblation that was made out of the Corn, when it was newly thraſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out: which was to be, they ſay, a <hi>fiftieth</hi> part; which was given to the Prieſt. Then the firſt Tithe, which was given to the Levites; and the ſecond Tithe, which the Poſſeſſors eat at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:60246:220"/>Tabernacle was ſetled there. This order, they ſay, God here requires them not to invert, by offering that laſt which ſhould have been firſt. So <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, Praecept.</hi> LXXVIII. But, from what follows, it ſeems to relate only to the Firſt-fruits of their Harveſt, and of their Vintage; which they were bound to bring as ſoon as they were ripe; and it was the Portion of the Prieſts. See XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. There was no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Portion preſcribed: but they who were tollerably good (as the Hebrews ſay) gave a <hi>fiftieth</hi> part; libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men a <hi>fortieth;</hi> and covetous Men a <hi>ſixtieth;</hi> leſs than which was not accepted for a <hi>Trumah.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>On the eighth day thou ſhalt give it me.</hi>] It was not acceptable to God, becauſe not fit to be offered to him, till the eighth day; for the ſame reaſon that Children were not Circumciſed till the eighth day. For all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures when they are newly born, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nevoch. c.</hi> 49.) by reaſon of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant moiſture, are ſo weak and feeble, that it is doubtful whether they will live or no: and therefore, till <hi>ſeven</hi> days be over, they are lookt upon as but Abortives, (ſo his words are) and ſcarce numbred among the Living. Beſides, they are not ſufficiently purged till then, from the foulneſs of their Stomach and Bowels: which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reaſon they were not to be offered unto God; who did not accept that which was imperfect or impure. Whatſoever was the reaſon, this Law was obſerved alſo among the Gentiles, as <hi>Bochart</hi> ſhows out of <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>Yet there was this difference between theſe, and the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:60246:221"/>Firſt-fruits mentioned in the foregoing Verſe; that though theſe Creatures were ſit for Sacrifice on the <hi>eighth</hi> day, yet they might ſtay longer before they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, though not beyond the year, for then they were not accepted, (as was obſerved before, XII. 5.) but the Firſt-fruits of Corn, Wine and Oyl, were to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently, as ſoon as they were ripe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And ye ſhall be holy men unto me.</hi>] Becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a peculiar People, ſeparated to God by peculiar Laws and Rites by him inſtituted, (and thence called an <hi>holy Nation,</hi> XIX. 6.) therefore God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to diſtinguiſh themſelves, even in their Diet, from other People: and look upon it as below their Dignity, to eat ſuch things as the Gentiles did. This is the meaning of their being holy to God, as appears from XIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 2, 3, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall ye eat any fleſh that is torn of beaſts in the field.</hi>] Both becauſe the Blood was in it, and it was devoured by unclean Creatures. <hi>R. Levi,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſaith it was unwholſome; which he makes the reaſon of the Prohibition. But whether it was torn by a Wolf, a Lion, or a Bear, or any other Beaſt, it made no difference, if ſo be it died preſently, or not long after. So the Jews interpret the Hebrew word <hi>Terephah,</hi> as <hi>L'Empereur</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Moſes Mikkotſi</hi> (in his Notes upon <hi>Bava kama, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.) who faith it ſignifies <hi>that which a Beast tears, or bruiſes, ſo that it is near to death, though it be not actually dead.</hi> For if it was dead, they call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Nevelah,</hi> a Carcaſe: which in their Language ſignifies not only that which dies of it ſelf, but which is killed with a Weapon, or torn by a wild Beaſt. Accordingly they take <hi>Terephah</hi> here to ſignifie not only that which is torn by Beaſts, but that which any other way is ſo hurt, that it is near to death. As if it fall from an Houſe, and break its Ribs, or other
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60246:221"/>Members; or an Arrow be ſhot through its Heart or Lungs; or any Diſeaſe have affected choſe Vital parts. If Death were likely to inſue upon ſuch things, it was not to be eaten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the field.</hi>] Whether it were torn in the Field, or any other place, it made no difference: but the <hi>Field</hi> is mentioned, becauſe there commonly ſuch things happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall cast it to the dogs.</hi>] <hi>R. Solomon</hi> ſaith, they might ſell it to the Gentiles, whom the Jews counted no better than Dogs. Which agrees with the Decree in the <hi>Miſna,</hi> (<hi>Bava kama, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.) that though it appeared afterward, a Thief had ſtoln what was torn, yet he was to make the Legal Reſtitution: contrary to the Opinion of <hi>R. Simeon,</hi> who abſolved ſuch a Thief, becauſe he might not eat it, and conſequently have no benefit by it. But moſt thought he might ſell it; and therefore was liable to make Satisfaction. If any <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> did eat of it, he was to be Scourged. Sir <hi>J.

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>THou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report.</hi>] The Hebrews think this Law peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Judges; who are not to ſuffer their Minds to be prepoſſeſſed with falſe Reports. For that word we tranſlate <hi>raiſe,</hi> ſignifies alſo to <hi>take up; i.e.</hi> to entertain, or <hi>receive</hi> (as we have it in the Margin) and give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to Reports. And conſequently they were not to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60246:222"/>hear any Man's Cauſe, unleſs his Adverſary was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but to look upon all as falſe, which was ſaid by one Party alone, without the other. So <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Yet he confeſſes, that the Law hath reſpect alſo to him, who brings an Action againſt another; that he ſhould not lay his Cauſe before the Judge, in the abſence of him that is to anſwer, though the Judge would hear it. And he alſo adds, that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> take it to comprehend ſuch, as report a Calumny, or that receive it; or give a falſe Teſtimony. And <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> thinks the Greeks from thence took that Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <hi>to make a proof of a hearſay;</hi> which was in the <hi>Attick</hi> Law, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 576. And it ſeems to me moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, to take this to relate to <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> (as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clauſe doth) that they ſhould neither Calumniate any Man, nor bring ungrounded Reports to carry a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſs.</hi>] This the Hebrews likewiſe think concerns Judges; who are required not to receive the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a wicked Man, nor do any thing upon his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions. And here they mention <hi>Ten</hi> ſorts of Perſons, whoſe Teſtimony was not to be received. But the laſt words in this Clauſe, inclines one to think, it rather concerns Witneſſes than Judges. For <hi>to put ones hand with another,</hi> is to help and aſſiſt him; to be confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him: And therefore <hi>to put the hand with the wicked,</hi> is to help a wicked Man in a bad Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> (as the laſt words interpret it) by giving a falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in his behalf. Of the Hebrew word <hi>Chamas,</hi> which we rightly render <hi>unrighteous,</hi> or unjuſt, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> hath a long Diſcourſe in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi>]
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:60246:222"/>This may well be thought to reſpect Judges, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſe doth Witneſſes. And the moſt obvious meaning is, That no Judge ſhould condemn an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man, though the whole Court, beſides himſelf, gave Sentence againſt him. But many of the Jews ſay, that they ſhould not Condemn one, whom they thought guilty, if he was caſt only by one Voice: If there were a majority of two, then indeed, they ſay, a Judge was bound to joyn with them. See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 229. and <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 259. where he ſhows they take the word <hi>evil</hi> in this place, to ſignifie the <hi>evil of puniſhment.</hi> See alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 525. But this ſeems to be only a Subtilty. Their Opinion is more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who by the Hebrew word <hi>Rabbim</hi> here underſtand, not a multitude, but <hi>great</hi> and <hi>potent</hi> Men: to whom a Judge was not to have reſpect in Judgment, no more than to a poor Man; who (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) is oppoſed to theſe Men of might. But what follows I think will better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a cauſe, to decline after many to wreſt Judgment.</hi>] This is interpreted by <hi>Maimonides</hi> to ſignifie, That no Judge was to give his Sentence in a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cauſe, either for Abſolving, or Condemning, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the reſt; if he were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver any Opinion of his own. See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> II. <hi>de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedr. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 529. Other fancies they have about the word <hi>Rabbim</hi> in this Clauſe of the Verſe, which he notes there, <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 421. But the ſenſe I think will be moſt plain and eaſie, if we take <hi>Rabbim</hi> in the firſt part of the Verſe (as we do) for the <hi>Multitude;</hi> and in this latter part for the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>potent</hi> or <hi>ruling</hi> Men, who are generally attended by a Multitude. And expound the whole thus; That the Judges were not to be deterred, either by the People, or by mighty Men, to pronounce a falſe Judgment. This agrees with what follows, and with XIX <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.</p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:60246:223"/>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Neither ſhalt thou countenance a poor man in his cauſe.</hi>] So as to give a wrong Judgment in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The word we tranſlate <hi>countenance</hi> (in Hebrew <hi>tehedar</hi>) ſignifies to <hi>adorn,</hi> or <hi>honour:</hi> and ſo we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it XIX <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. And ſo it may be tranſlated here; Thou ſhalt not adorn, or ſet off a poor Man's Cauſe, with fine words and plauſible colours, to make it look better than it is. See I <hi>Deut.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>If thou meet thy enemies ox or aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again.</hi>] The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copy adds (after <hi>ox or aſs</hi>) <hi>or any other beast.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf extends it to all ſorts of Goods that are loſt, XXII <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. But the Jewiſh Doctors (as <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> confeſſes) reſtrain the word <hi>Enemy,</hi> to an <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> as if they thought not themſelves bound to any ſuch kindneſs for one of another Nation. This perhaps they gathered from XXII <hi>Deut.</hi> 1, 2. where inſtead of the word <hi>Enemy,</hi> we find <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes the word <hi>Brother.</hi> But this ſhould have taught them, to look upon all Men, even Enemies, as Brethren; having the ſame common Original, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Image of the ſame God.</p>
               <p>This Verſe may be connected with the foregoing in this manner; <hi>If you be inclined to ſhow pity,</hi> do it in ſuch Inſtances as theſe, but not in Judgment.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>If thou ſee the aſs of him that hateth thee, lying under his burden.</hi>] His Aſs is only mention'd, but Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and other ſuch like Creatures are intended; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the former Verſe. Yet this likewiſe the hard-hearted Jewiſh Doctors, would have belong only to an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> who hated them. And they put ſeveral Caſes upon this Law: As, what if the Beaſt be a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>'s, and the Burden belong to an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> or on the contrary; what is to be done? And if they meet with two Beaſts belonging both to <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and labouring under Burdens; but one the Beaſt of a Friend, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:60246:223"/>of an Enemy; which is he bound to help? In which they reſolve, that he is by this Precept to have regard to the Beaſt of his Enemy: that he may ſubdue his evil Affection, which would perſwade him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. How far alſo the word <hi>ſee</hi> extends, is a queſtion among them: that is, how far they were to go out of their way to lend their help: with ſuch like Niceties, which I ſhall not trouble the Reader withal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And wouldſt forbear to help him, thou ſhalt ſurely help with him.</hi>] The ſenſe is clear enough: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words, in the Hebrew, is not ſo plain. For the word <hi>Azab,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>help,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>leave</hi> or <hi>forſake:</hi> and ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> here interprets it; <hi>Thou ſhalt in that moment diſmiſs or forſake thy enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, and go and help him.</hi> And <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Rather than leave him under his Burden, quit thine enmity to him,</hi> &amp;c. A great many other ways there are to make out the Grammar of the Hebrew words; but <hi>Bochart</hi> thinks all in vain: unleſs inſtead of the Particle <hi>lo</hi> with a <hi>Vau,</hi> we admit it with an <hi>Aleph:</hi> and then they run clearly in the Hebrew in this manner, <hi>Thou ſhalt ceaſe (or abſtain) from leaving him,</hi> (i. e. not follow thy own ill inclinations to paſs by him) <hi>leaving thou ſhalt not leave him,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> by no means leave him) <hi>viz.</hi> to raiſe up his Beaſt himſelf, as if it nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned thee. Or, <hi>Thou ſhalt abſtain from leaving it,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Aſs, labouring under his Burden) <hi>I ſay thou ſhalt by no means leave it.</hi> The ſame thing is repeated, becauſe it is a Command ſo oppoſite to Mens depraved Affections; and therefore was fit to be inculcated, that they might not lightly paſs it over. See <hi>Hierozoio. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 40. <hi>p.</hi> 399.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt not wreſt the judgment of thy poor in his cauſe.</hi>] As they might not favour a Man becauſe he was poor, (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) ſo much leſs might they wrong
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60246:224"/>him; or not do him right, becauſe he wanted Money to proſecute it. There ſeems to be an Emphaſis (as <hi>Conradus Pellicanus</hi> obſerves) in the word <hi>thy</hi> poor: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that they had ſuch a relation to them, that they ought to be as much concerned for them, as any other Member of their Body.</p>
               <p>But the Jews fancying this to be ſufficiently included in the Precept before mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 3. underſtand here by the <hi>poor,</hi> a bad man: who is <hi>pauper praeceptorum, non facultatum,</hi> one that wants Vertue, not Money. To whom a Judge might not ſay, He was a wicked Fellow, and Condemn him without any further Examination of his Cauſe: for it belongs to God (ſaith the ſame <hi>R. Levi</hi>) to execute Judgment upon the ungodly, and not to the Judges.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Keep thee far from a falſe matter.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> From a falſe Judgment (for he ſeems to ſpeak to the Judges) and neither admit that which is falſe, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the innocent and righteous ſlay thou not.</hi>] That is, ſaith the before-named <hi>R. Levi Barzel,</hi> beware careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt thou takeſt away the Life of him, that may be innocent of that, whereof he is accuſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſaith, the Judges were to Condemn no Man, but by the Teſtimony of two <hi>Eye-witneſſes.</hi> And they make this Precept as much as, <hi>Thou ſhalt not judge out of Conjectures.</hi> Nay, if there were two Witneſſes, that did not ſpeak to the ſame matter, he was not to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. As if one Witneſs ſaid, he ſaw ſuch a Man break the Sabbath, and another ſaid he ſaw him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry; Judgment was not to be given againſt him, upon this Teſtimony; becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Slay not the Innocent.</hi> Another Example of which is ſtill more cloſe, which is mentioned in the <hi>T. Sanhedrim:</hi> If one ſaid he ſaw him Worſhip the Moon; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60246:224"/>that he ſaw him Worſhip the Sun; the Man was not to be Condemned who was thus accuſed, becauſe the Witneſſes did not ſpeak to the ſame ſort of Idolatry. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 567. By the ſame reaſon they were not to acquit him, who was plainly Convicted of ſuch Impieties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I will not juſtifie the wicked.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Such an unjuſt Judge.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And thou ſhalt take no gift.</hi>] No, not to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Innocent; or to Condemn the Guilty: as it is interpreted in <hi>Siphri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a gift blindeth the wiſe.</hi>] Such Preſents made to a Judge, are apt to caſt a Miſt (as we ſpeak) before his Eyes, <hi>i.e.</hi> to corrupt his Underſtanding; though he be otherwiſe perſpicacious enough, to diſcern between Truth and Falſhood, Good and Evil, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 3.

               <p>The Hebrew Lawyers ſay, That not only Pecuniary Gifts are here forbidden, but ſuch words alſo (I ſuppoſe they mean Promiſes of Reward) as may win the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and that he who gave the Preſent was guilty, as well as he that received it. See <hi>Selden de Synedriis, L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 570. But eſpecially <hi>Joh. Coch. ad excerpt. Gem. Sanhedrim. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10. <hi>Annot.</hi> 4. where, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he gives this ingenious derivation of the Hebrew word <hi>Schochad,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>gift</hi> (out of the Treatiſe called <hi>Chetuboth</hi>) where it is ſaid to be as much as <hi>Schechu chad,</hi> that is, <hi>whereby he is one.</hi> For the Party who receives the Gift hath his Mind ſo drawn
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60246:225"/>to the giver, that <hi>he becomes one and the ſame with him.</hi> And no Man is fit to be Judge in his own Cauſe. <hi>Plato</hi> thought this ſo neceſſary a Law, that he expreſly enacts (<hi>L.</hi> XII. <hi>de Legibus, p.</hi> 955.) that all Men who ſerved their Country in any Office, ſhould <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtranger.</hi>] This was ſaid before XXII. 21. but then it was a Precept to all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which is here applied peculiarly to <hi>Judges.</hi> Whom he would have to deal equally with Strangers, and to make no difference between them and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> remembring what they themſelves were not long ago; and that they found by experience it was Affliction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be Strangers. That's the meaning of what follows in this Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of</hi> Egypt.] Ye have felt what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Condition that is; how friendleſs and helpleſs. See XXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 17, 18. XXVII. 19.</p>

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>But the ſeventh year thou ſhalt let it rest, and lie ſtill.</hi>] Neither ſow, nor reap, nor prune their Trees, nor gather the Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The poor of thy people may eat.</hi>] And the Levites, and themſelves alſo; who might take their ſhare, not to lay
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60246:225"/>up, but for preſent uſe: though not as Proprietors, but in common with the reſt of the Country. Whence it was that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, allowing them to live by their ancient Laws, among other things granted <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And what they leave, the beaſts of the field ſhall eat.</hi>] This ſignifies, God ſent ſuch vaſt Plenty, when they obſerved his Laws, that ſo much ſprung up of it ſelf, as would more than ſatisfie Men, and afford Food to the Beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner thou ſhalt deal with thy vineyard and olive-yard.</hi>] Under theſe two are comprehended all other ſort of Fruit-trees, as the Hebrews themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who give ſeveral Reaſons for this Law. Which was ordained, ſaith <hi>Maimonides</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>More Nevoch. c.</hi> 39.) in compaſſion to all Men in general, that they might have ſome time of breathing and refreſhment. But principally, ſay others of them, to be a memorial of the Creation of the World, and the production of all things by the Power of God, in ſix days, and his reſting on the ſeventh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Their expoſing all things in common which that year produced, as well as letting the Land reſt, <hi>Put them in remembrance</hi> (ſaith <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona, Praecept.</hi> LXIX.) <hi>that God was their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, as well as Creator: the Earth bringing forth Fruit every year, not by its own proper ſtrength, or of its own accord, but becauſe it hath a Lord upon whom it depends; who, when he ſpeaks, hath a right to diſpoſe of its Fruits to a publick uſe.</hi> This Command alſo bred in them a truſt in God and in his Providence; and was a Curb to Covetouſneſs, and taught them Mercy alſo and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. <hi>Philo</hi> adds, that this was a Politick contrivance
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60246:226"/>to let the Earth reſt: partly that it might have time to recruit its ſtrength, that it might bring forth more plentifully; and partly that the People might grow ſtronger and more apt for all Employments, by ſo long forbearance of their Labours. This <hi>Euſebius</hi> thought worthy to tranſcribe out of him at large in his <hi>Praepar. Evang. L.</hi> VIII. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But this Precept about the Year of Reſt, is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered in XXV <hi>Lev. v.</hi> 2, 3. where ſee what I have noted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Six days thou ſhalt do thy work, and on the ſeventh day thou ſhalt rest.</hi>] He would not have them imagine, they ſhould reſt leſs on the Sabbath this Year, than in others, becauſe this whole Year was a kind of Sabbath; but keep it with the uſual ſtrictneſs. Which is the reaſon perhaps of the repetition of this Precept in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thine ox and thine aſs may rest,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows that one great end of inſtituting the Obſervation of this Day at <hi>Marah</hi> (XV. 25. XVI. 23.) was that Men and Beaſts might reſt, in remembrance of the reſt that God had given them from their Burdens in <hi>Egypt.</hi> See XXXV. 2. <hi>R. Levi Barzelonita</hi> obſerves that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is repeated in the Law XII. times.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>In all things that I have ſaid unto you, be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect.</hi>] Be cautious leſt you offend in any of the fore-named Particulars; but eſpecially in that which follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And make no mention of the names of other gods.</hi>] Such Cautions as theſe, to prevent Idolatry, are repeated no leſs than XLIV. times in the Law, as the ſame <hi>R. Levi</hi> obſerves. And the meaning of this is, either that they ſhould not Swear by other Gods, or make any Vows in their Names; nor conſequently enter into Society with Gentiles (as the beſt of the Hebrew Writers underſtand
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60246:226"/>it, and as the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> takes it) or that they ſhould not ſo much as ſimply name the Gods of other Nations. They who are of this laſt Opinion, differ in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. For ſome of them ſay, only the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them by ſuch Names as attribute ſome Divinity to them, is the thing forbidden; not calling them by their proper Names of <hi>Moloch</hi> or <hi>Bell,</hi> or the like: and thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> underſtood it. But there are others, who think it unlawful ſo much as to uſe any of their Names in common Diſcourſe; though there be no mention of their Divinity. For <hi>Chemoſh</hi> and <hi>Milcom,</hi> and ſuch like Names, they ſay, are not mentioned in Scripture, but with deteſtation and reproach (as the Abomination of the <hi>Moabites</hi> or <hi>Ammonites</hi>) and therefore they think it unlawful to ſay, <hi>I invite thee on the Feast-day of ſuch an Idol of the Gentiles,</hi> or the like. Yet ſome of thoſe who imagine the ſimple uſe of their Names to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, except the Names of thoſe mention'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So <hi>Maimonides;</hi> The Names of the Idols of the Gentiles which are mentioned in Scripture, it is lawful for us to Name; as <hi>Peor, Bell, Nebo, Baal,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 269, &amp;c. They ſay, this Precept binds Men and Women, in all places, and at all times; and the Puniſhment for its violation, was beating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall it be heard out of thy mouth.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> With any reſpect or reverence to them: Otherwiſe, the ſimple pronunciation of the Name was not unlawful.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath being inſtituted, partly to preſerve them from Idolatry, ſome think that the reaſon why this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is joyned to that.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Three times ſhalt thou keep a feast unto me in the year.</hi>] <hi>Viz.</hi> At the <hi>Paſſover, Pentecoſt,</hi> and when they gathered all the Fruits of the Earth, and dwelt in Tabernacles; as it follows in the next Verſes. The

                  <hi>first</hi> of which was plainly inſtituted, in memory of their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The <hi>ſecond,</hi> ſome think, was in memory of their coming into <hi>Canaan</hi> (rather, of the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Sea, and giving the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>). And the <hi>third</hi> in memory of their dwelling ſo long in the Wilderneſs, and of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which God did there; as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves in his <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 43. At theſe three great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities <hi>three</hi> things were to be done: <hi>First,</hi> they were to make a Feaſt: <hi>Secondly,</hi> to appear before God in the Court of the Temple: and <hi>thirdly</hi> to rejoyce.

                  <hi>And none ſhall appear before me empty.</hi>] The phraſe in the Hebrew (which we tranſlate <hi>appear before me</hi>) is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, <hi>viz. None ſhall ſee my face:</hi> Which doth not ſignifie that they beheld the External Symbol of his Preſence; but that they looked directly that way where it was; and that they ſhould not be accepted by God, unleſs they brought ſome Preſent with them. For none approached to an Earthly Majeſty in thoſe Countries without a Preſent, (as we read in the Sacred Story) which was a Token of Love and Affection, as well as of Reſpect and Honour. And therefore this Precept
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:60246:227"/>did not belong only to this Feaſt, but to all the <hi>three</hi> mentioned in the Verſe before, as appears from XVI <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. And accordingly there were ſpecial Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordained by the Law it ſelf, which were then to be made. At the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> when their Harveſt began, they were to bring <hi>a Sheaf of the First-fruits of their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi> and might not eat any Corn till this was done, XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10, 14. At the next Feaſt they brought <hi>two wave Loaves,</hi> for a ſecond Firſt-fruit, of their Wheat-harveſt, XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. and at the Feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they offered the Firſt-fruits of Wine and Oyl. See Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Diſcourſe XLVI. <hi>p.</hi> 355. Beſides all which, good Men brought Free-will Offerings; which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned in the Law.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And the feast of harvest.</hi>] Called alſo the <hi>Feast of Weeks,</hi> XXXIV. 22. becauſe it was Seven Weeks after the Paſſover. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in the place now named, thinks this was called the <hi>Harvest Feast;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as Harveſt began at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> ſo it ended at <hi>Pentecost.</hi> And thus <hi>Bochart</hi> alſo: <hi>At the Paſſover they first put the Sickle into the Corn; and about Pentecost Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest was finiſhed, and all brought into the Barn.</hi> Hierozoic. <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 13. But this ſeems not to be true; for now only the Firſt-fruits were brought: which were not offered in the end, but in the beginning of Harveſt. And ſo it follows here;</p>

                  <hi>The first-fruits of thy labours which thou hast ſown in the field.</hi>] Which is not to be underſtood of all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but of thoſe Fruits which were firſt ſown in the Ground. It being therefore called the <hi>Harvest Feast,</hi> becauſe the principal part of Harveſt, <hi>viz. the Wheat Harvest</hi> (as it is expreſly called XXXIV. 22.) then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: which ſort of Grain was ſown before Barley, as that was before Flax; and therefore here called <hi>the firſt-fruits of their labours ſown in the field.</hi>

                  <hi>And the feast of in-gathering.</hi>] Called alſo the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is in the end of the year.</hi>] By this it appears that their Year anciently began in the Month <hi>Tiſri,</hi> about Autumn: at which time the World it ſelf began, as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> and a great many other Learned Men aſſert, with ſuch Reaſons as are not eaſie to be confuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</hi>] At this Feaſt their Harveſt was compleated; the Fruits of the Earth being not only ripe, but gathered into their Barns. Which was the foundation of the great rejoying we read of at this time; becauſe God now gave them ſome reſt, and reſpiration, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſpeaks, from their Imployments, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 43. where he obſerves that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, in his VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of <hi>Ethicks,</hi> mentions ſuch a Feaſt among the Gentiles, and upon the ſame ground, in theſe words, as he recites them. <hi>Anciently Sacrifices, and publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the ſake of Sacrifices, were in the gathering of the Fruits and Products of the Earth: as if the Sacrifices were offered for their reſpiration.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dwelt in <hi>Booths</hi> at this Feaſt for another reaſon: and their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Booths was now moſt tollerable (as the ſame <hi>Maimonides</hi> there notes) becauſe the Weather was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate at that time; when they were not wont to be troubled either with heat, or with rain.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Three times in the year all thy males ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the LORD God.</hi>] This Verſe more fully explains what was ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 14. by ſhowing <hi>where</hi> they ſhould keep theſe Feaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> before the LORD; <hi>i. e.</hi> in the place where his moſt glorious Majeſty ſhould ſettle; which was firſt in the Tabernacle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Temple: And then <hi>who</hi> ſhould appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him there, <hi>viz.</hi> all the <hi>Males.</hi> Others were not bound to it; though ſome Religious People carried
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60246:228"/>their whole Families with them, as appears by <hi>Elkanah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. This Command is repeated XXXIV. 23. and the true reaſon of it ſeems to have been this: That while they dwelt in the Wilderneſs they are no Meat at all at their private Tables, but what had been firſt offered up to God at the Tabernacle, XVII <hi>Lev.</hi> 4, 5. Which Precept was diſpenſed withal when they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and dwelt, many of them, ſo remote from the Tabernacle, that they could not come up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to Sacrifice, XII <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. Inſtead of which therefore there were theſe <hi>three</hi> conſtant and ſet times appointed in the year; in which every Male was bound to come up, and ſee God at his Tabernacle, and there ate and drink before him. Whence the Sacrifice which was then offered, was wont to be called <hi>a Sacrifice of Seeing,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath obſerved in his little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Right Notion of the Lord's Supper.</hi> But, as the Doctors interpret it, they were not bound to bring their Males to appear before the LORD, till they were able to walk, in their Father's hand, up from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Temple.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not offer the blood of my Sacrifice.</hi>] That is, the Paſchal Lamb, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> in expreſs words interprets; and it appears from XXXIV. 25. That the Paſſover was a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> I obſerved before XII. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With leavened bread,</hi> &amp;c.] There being <hi>three</hi> great Solemn Feaſts appointed in the foregoing Verſes, (<hi>v.</hi> 14, 17.) in this and the following he preſcribes ſome Rules how they were to be obſerved. And here, in this Verſe, ordains <hi>two</hi> things relating to the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> that it ſhould not be <hi>eaten with leavened bread;</hi> nor any of the <hi>Fat of it remain until the morning.</hi> Both which were ordained before (XII. 10, 14, 15.) in its firſt Inſtitution: and here repeated, upon its being mention'd again with the other Feaſts.</p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:60246:229"/>
               <p>It may be ſit for me here to obſerve, that to move the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to keep this <hi>Paſſover</hi> with the greater care, God calls it both here, and in XXXIV. 25. after a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, <hi>my ſacrifice,</hi> and <hi>my Feast</hi> (as the latter part of this Verſe may be tranſlated) being a Feaſt of a moſt Solemn Nature; and a Sacrifice then offered of ſingular uſe. For which reaſon he requires them, as not to offer it with Leaven (which was at that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden for ſpecial reaſons) ſo not to reſerve the Fat of the Offering till the next day. For that was not for the honour of the Sacrifice: Fleſh being apt quickly to corrupt in thoſe hot Countries, and to offend the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or the Noſe, which had been againſt the dignity of the Sacrifice. Which is the reaſon the Jews give, why the Fleſh of the Peace offerings was not to be kept till the third day, XIX <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. It was to preſerve <hi>the magnificence of the Sacrifice;</hi> things kept ſo long being apt to ſtink. Whence <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The first of the first-fruits of thy land, thou ſhalt bring unto the houſe of the LORD thy God.</hi>] This Precept hath a reſpect to the next Feaſt, that of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.</hi> And therefore, though there were ſeveral <hi>First-fruits,</hi> which were all to be offered in their time (which were of <hi>ſeven</hi> things, <hi>Barley, Wheat, Figs, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Olives, Dates,</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi>) yet here are meant only the two <hi>Loaves</hi> or <hi>Cakes</hi> made of their new Wheat, which were to be offered at this Feaſt, (XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.) For till this was done, they might not make uſe of their Corn. See more concerning this matter on XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. <hi>R.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeethe a Kid in its mothers milk.</hi>] This Precept hath a particular reſpect to the third Feaſt, that of the <hi>in-gathering of the Fruits of the Earth, in the end of the Year,</hi> mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 16. And the Jews common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it to be a Prohibition againſt eating a Kid ſo boil'd, or taſting of the Milk: taking it to be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt Cruelty. But here is not a word about <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> either of the Kid or the Milk; but only about <hi>boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The famous <hi>Bochartus</hi> mentions <hi>three</hi> other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, but confutes them all: and taking the words ſimply, as we tranſlate them, ſuppoſes there was ſome ſuch Cuſtom as this among the Gentiles, which <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have them imitate. And ſo doth <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in his <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 48. where he takes this indeed for a Command not to eat Fleſh with ſuch Milk: but ſaith, that, beſides it was very groſs Nouriſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſeems to him it was prohibited, becauſe it ſmelt of Idolatry; the Gentiles doing ſo in their Worſhip, upon ſome of their Feaſts. He could not find indeed, as he confeſſes, any ſuch Rite in the Books of the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii:</hi> but yet he was confirm'd in this Opinion, by the Law conſtantly mentioning this, only when it ſpeaks of their Feaſts; for there are other places where we meet with it, XXXIV. 26. XVI <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. in both which he ſpeaks, as he doth here, of their <hi>three</hi> great Feaſts. At the laſt of which, <hi>Abarbinel</hi> expreſly affirms, the ancient Idolaters were wont, when they gathered the Fruits of the Earth, to ſeeth a Kid in its Mothers Milk, that their Gods might be the more propitious to them. But as he names no Author for his opinion, ſo he doth not explain the manner of it. Our moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> was the firſt Perſon who happily found this in a <hi>Karaite</hi> writer; who ſaith, <hi>All the Trees and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:60246:230"/>Fields and Gardens were ſprinkled with this broth</hi> (of a Kid ſeethed in its Mother's Milk) <hi>after a magical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to make them more fruitful in the following year.</hi> This <hi>Bochart</hi> alſo takes to be the trueſt Interpretation, and quotes the fore-named Doctor for it, (not having ſeen the Author himſelf.) <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 52. See <hi>Right Notion of the Lord's Supper, p.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>To which may be added, that a Goat was anciently uſed in Magical Rites; and that <hi>Daemons</hi> were wont to appear in that form. But it muſt be noted withal, that in every one of the <hi>three</hi> places, where this Precept is mentioned, the LXX. tranſlate the word we render <hi>Kid,</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And I make no queſtion, but we are to underſtand here either a <hi>Lamb,</hi> or <hi>Kid</hi> boil'd in its Mother's Milk; and the Hebrews ſay, any other clean Creature. Concerning which I ſhall add no more, but that nothing could be more contrary to Nature (and therefore agreeable to the Inſtitutions of the Devil) than to boil any young Creature, in the Milk of its Mother, from whom it came. Which they firſt offered to their Gods, and then eat ſome of it themſelves, and the reſt they ſprinkled, as before-ſaid. Some Reliques of which Cuſtom we find even among the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, who propitiated <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> with offering him Milk, and <hi>Faunus</hi> with a <hi>Kid:</hi> and every one knows both theſe were uſed in the Worſhip of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſend an Angel before thee.</hi>] In the 23th Verſe he calls him <hi>mine Angel:</hi> by which the Jews commonly underſtand <hi>Michael;</hi> there being but a very little difference between <hi>Malachi</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>my Angel</hi>) and <hi>Michael.</hi> But a great many Chriſtians think this was not a created Angel, but an increated, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal Son of God; who they ſuppoſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, and conducted them all
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60246:230"/>along to Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Which I am affraid to aſſert, becauſe it ſeems dangerous to me (as I obſerved upon XLVIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.) to call him ſimply an <hi>Angel; i. e.</hi> a Miniſter, or Meſſenger, without any ſuch addition as that in III <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. <hi>The Angel of the Covenant.</hi> For ſo he was at his Incarnation of which he there ſpeaks: before which I dare not aſcribe to him ſuch Miniſterial Works as theſe, of bringing the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and going before them to lead them the way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> This was properly the Work of an Angel, to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> attributes it, when he orders his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to ſay to the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> XX <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>When we cried unto the LORD he heard our voice, and ſent an Angel, and hath brought us forth out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Angel was a prime Miniſter in the heavenly Hoſt, by whom he was accompanied. So he ſaith to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> V. 14. <hi>I am come as Captain of the Host of the LORD:</hi> which is the Title of <hi>Michael</hi> in X <hi>Daniel</hi> 13, 21. But though we thus underſtand it here, this doth not exclude the Preſence of God himſelf, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves it: For this Angel and his Hoſt, was ſent from the SCHECHINAH, who was in the <hi>Pillar of Cloud;</hi> which was moved by this Angel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them through the Wilderneſs. See III. 2.</p>

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And I will ſend hornets before thee.</hi>] Either before they came thither, or when they marcht againſt the People of that Country. Both ſeem to be true: that many of them were forced to quit their Country, when it was infeſted by the Hornets God ſent in great Swarms among them; and that they who remained, when they came to ſight, were aſſaulted by theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which flew in their faces, and ſo forely prickt their Eyes (as <hi>Kimchi</hi> and <hi>R. Solomon</hi> take it) that they could not ſee to ſtrike a ſtroke. Whence thoſe words of <hi>Joſhua</hi> (who expreſly ſaith this was fulfilled) XXIV. 12. that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were not driven out by the Sword
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:60246:233"/>and bow of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but by the Sting of theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. Which ſeem alſo to have purſued them when they fled away, and killed them in their lurking holes, where they hid themſelves after the fight, VII <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which ſhall drive out.</hi>] That ſeveral Nations have been driven out of their Country, by contemptible Creatures, ſuch as Frogs, Mice, Snakes, and Gnats, is made good by <hi>Bochartus</hi> out of ſeveral Authors. And he hath particularly ſhown that by theſe very Creatures, <hi>Waſps</hi> and <hi>Bees,</hi> People have been forced to forſake their Country, as <hi>Herodotus, Appianus,</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> teſtiſie.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.</hi>] Theſe three Nations it ſeems were principally infeſted by the Hornets; among whom perhaps they were more venomous than elſewhere, (for ſo <hi>R. Solomon</hi> ſaith, their Poyſon was deadly) though the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo felt their Sting, as we read in XXIV <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>I will not drive them out from before thee in one year.</hi>] All the reaſons of which are not here decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (as they are elſewhere, III <hi>Judg.</hi> 1, 2, 3.) becauſe he would not diſhearten them.</p>

For if all the People of the VII.
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:60246:233"/>Nations, had been deſtroyed at once, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not yet numerous enough to People the whole Country; eſpecially when two Tribes and an half were ſettled on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And I will ſet thy bounds,</hi> &amp;c.] This was the utmoſt extent of the Country, which he intended to beſtow upon them, (See XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.) but they did not enjoy it till the times of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 1, 3, &amp;c. and <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> IV. 21, 24. when their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſeems to have been enlarged not only to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> but even beyond it, IV <hi>Ezra.</hi> 16, 20. (See my Paraphraſe upon LXXII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.) Before theſe times, it appears by the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and thoſe that follow, that many of the old Inhabitaints remained long after his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the Red-ſea to the ſea of the Philiſtines.</hi>] Theſe were the Bounds from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi> For though the <hi>Red-ſea</hi> was towards the <hi>South,</hi> yet the farthermoſt part of it lay Eaſt. And the <hi>Sea of the Philiſtines</hi> is that now called the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which was full <hi>West.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For I will deliver the inhabitants of the Land into thy hand.</hi>] This ſeems to relate to that Land which the VII. Nations inhabited: for as far as <hi>Euphrates</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drove out all the Inhabitants, but only made them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries.</p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:60246:234"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt drive them out before thee.</hi>] In ſuch manner as is mentioned in the foregoing Verſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>Thou ſhalt make no covenant with them.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> With the People of the VII. Nations. But with other Gentiles they might make Covenants: only not ſuffer them to live in their Land, unleſs they renounced all Idolatry. Nay, <hi>Maimonides</hi> is of opinion, that ſuch of the VII. Nations, as renounced Idolatry, were to be received into their Friendſhip: For that Law in the XX <hi>Deut.</hi> which requires them to ſend a Summons to every City before they beſieged it, with an offer of Peace, he extends even unto them; and grounds his opinion upon XI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19, 20. As for that Objection which ſeems to lye againſt this, about the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who needed not by craft to have obtained a League with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if this were true Doctrine: His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, That <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſent a Summons, with offers of Peace to them, and all the reſt; which they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but would afterward have gladly accepted, and then it was not to be admitted: and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived that cunning way to be received into Friendſhip with the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> See <hi>P. Cunaeus L.</hi> II. <hi>de Republ. Hebr. c.</hi> 20. And <hi>Selden L.</hi> VI. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 13. where he quotes a Paſſage out of the <hi>Hieruſalem Gemara,</hi> which ſays, That <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſent three Letters to the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> But he ſhows withal, that other Jews contradict this; and expreſly declare the VII. Nations were not to be invited to peace. What the terms were on which others were invited. See there <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>All this conſidered, I am inclined to think <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> his opinion too true; which that place in <hi>Joſhua</hi> very much favours; and ſo doth the ſtory of <hi>Rahab,</hi> and the practice of <hi>Solomon;</hi> who only put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of theſe Nations under Tribute, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> IX. 20, 21.</p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:60246:234"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor with their gods.</hi>] This prohibits them to ſuffer any of the VII. Nations to Exerciſe Idolatry among them, as <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> interprets it. Or rather, he forbids them to make any Vows to their Gods, or oblige themſelves to perform any Act of Worſhip to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>They ſhall not dwell in thy land.</hi>] If a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile did renounce his Idolatry, he might dwell among them; and was called a Stranger, <hi>Toſhab,</hi> dwelling, or inhabiting. But if he did not forſake it, they might not ſell him a Foot of Land, nor let him Hire a Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: only he might come and ſell Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to them, as the ſame <hi>R. Levi</hi> expounds it. But <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſays, they might not ſo much as ſuffer them to paſs through their Country, when they had power to hinder it; which others think too rigid an Opinion, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhows, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 155, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest they make thee ſin against me.</hi>] All Society with Idolaters was forbidden, leſt they ſhould infect the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with their Infidelity, (as the ſame <hi>R. Levi</hi> ſpeaks) of which there was the greater danger, becauſe they were too prone to follow the Gentile Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if thou ſerve their gods.</hi>] This Caution being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated three times in this Chapter, ought to have been the more diligently obſerved by the Jews, and made them more fearful of entring into Familiarity with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters. Who were of various ſorts; for not only every Nation had its proper and peculiar Gods, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City, Town, Houſe, n ay every Man made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Gods according to their fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It will ſurely be a ſnare unto thee.</hi>] Bring great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon thee, and at laſt be thy ruin; as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained XXIII <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13. II <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. For inſtead of driving out the VII. Nations, they brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> under
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:60246:235"/>their yoke, and grievouſly oppreſſed them; as we read in the Story of the <hi>Judges;</hi> particularly in the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>Thou, and</hi> Aaron, Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But not all to the ſame nearneſs unto the Divine Majeſty; as appears by the following Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſeventy of the Elders of</hi> Iſrael.] This ſeems to intimate that there were more than LXX. called Elders: But theſe were the Chief, being perhaps the Heads of thoſe Families which came into <hi>Egypt;</hi> which were juſt <hi>Seventy.</hi> See XVIII. 12. For he doth not direct <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> how to chuſe them (as <hi>Corn. Bertram</hi> obſerves, <hi>L. de Repub.

And therefore called <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> or as the Latines ſpeak, <hi>Magnates, ſeu Optimates,</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:60246:235"/>the <hi>great Men, of the best quality in</hi> Iſrael.

               <p>
                  <hi>And worſhip ye afar off.</hi>] All of them, before they came to the Mount, were, at a good diſtance from it, to fall down proſtrate before God, that they might be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with ſuch an holy Reverence to him, as not to preſume to approach nearer than they were ordered.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>alone ſhall come near the LORD.</hi>] Unto the very top of the Mount, where the Glory of the LORD abode, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. unto which none was admitted but himſelf.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And told the People all the words of the LORD, and all the Judgments.</hi>] Some underſtand here by the <hi>words of the LORD,</hi> the Ten Commandments, called the <hi>Ten Words,</hi> XXXVIII. 18. But theſe words the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heard ſpoken by God himſelf; and not by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore I take theſe words to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie rather what he had ſpoken in the latter part of the foregoing Chapter, from the 20th Verſe to the end. And then <hi>by all the Judgments,</hi> he means thoſe Laws which he had received for their good Government in the XXI, XXII Chapters, and the former part of the XXIII.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the people anſwered with one voice, and ſaid.</hi>] In all likelyhood <hi>Moſes</hi> had told the Elders what God had ſaid to him; and they went and told it to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who gave the following Anſwer to them. For thus it was before XIX. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the words that the LORD hath ſaid, will we do.</hi>] They had conſented before in <hi>general,</hi> to do whatſoever God required of them; having him for their King and Governour (XIX. 6, 7, 8.) but now they conſent in <hi>particular,</hi> after God had declared what he would have them do (in the XX Chapter) and <hi>Moſes</hi> had alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the reſt of the Judgments delivered in the XXI, XXII, XXIII Chapters.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>wrote all the words of the LORD.</hi>] Both the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and all the reſt of the Judgments delivered in the foregoing Chapters. God indeed wrote the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> himſelf: but for the preſent <hi>Moſes</hi> made a Record of them, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not only hear, but read what they had to do.</p>

That is, on the <hi>ſixth</hi> of our <hi>June,</hi> as <hi>Jac. Capellus</hi> reckons. Therefore on the <hi>eighth</hi> of <hi>Sivan</hi> he built the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it here follows.</p>

                  <hi>And twelve Pillars, according to the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael.] This was to repreſent all the People. The Gentiles abuſing ſuch Pillars to Idolatrous uſes, the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is afterward forbidden in the Law.

But I have often obſerved before (particularly XIX. 22.) that I can ſee no proof of this, that they only officiated as Prieſts: every Man anciently, in his own Family, having a right to offer Sacrifice, till the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> reſtrained it to the Family of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Therefore I take theſe <hi>young men</hi> to have been the choiceſt Perſons among them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>First-born</hi> or others, who had been appointed to

For which they anciently choſe the ſtrongeſt and propereſt Perſons, as we ſee in the Greek ſtory of <hi>Jaſon</hi> (which our Learned Dr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 140.) whoſe Sacrifices were led to the Altar by the young men of his Company, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men of greateſt ſtrength and beauty, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Argonaut.</hi> And this ſo far remained, after the Prieſthood was conſined to the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that no Man was permitted to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate at the Altar, after he was <hi>Fifty</hi> years of Age; that is, when he was paſt his beſt, (as we ſpeak) the flower and ſtrength of his Age, VIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus Scacchus</hi> conjectures that there were XII. of theſe young Men, one of each Tribe, who offered in the Name of their Brethren, <hi>Myrothec.

               <p>
                  <hi>And half of the Blood he ſprinkled on the Altar.</hi>] The Altar repreſenting God, (as was ſaid before <hi>v.</hi> 4.) this Blood ſprinkled upon it, ſignified that he for his part engaged to be faithful in the Covenant, he now made with them, and they with him; by performing all the Promiſes he had newly made them by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the foregoing Chapter; eſpecially, thoſe <hi>four</hi> great Promiſes, of <hi>Plenty, Health, numerous Off-ſpring,</hi> and <hi>Long-life,</hi> v. 25, 26. together with the driving out the People of <hi>Canaan</hi> from before them, <hi>v.</hi> 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And he took the Book.</hi>] Some have made it a difficulty to find, what Book this was; and have been pleaſed to fancy that ſome Book which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote is loſt. When this plainly refers to what is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 4. where we read that <hi>Moſes wrote all the words of the LORD,</hi> that is, the <hi>Commandments</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> mentioned in the <hi>four</hi> foregoing Chapters. Which though they made no great Volume, yet might be called a Book in their Language: for even the Bill of Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they gave their Wives (and was very ſhort) is called by this Name of <hi>Sepher,</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> XXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Covenant.</hi>] That they might remember upon what terms he would beſtow upon them the fore-named Bleſſings, he engages them in a Solemn Covenant to obſerve the Commandments and Judgments contained in this Book.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took the blood.</hi>] That half of it which was in the Baſons, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſprinkled it on the people.</hi>] As he had ſprinkled one half on the Altar, in token God was a Party in the Covenant: ſo he ſprinkled the other half on the XII. Pillars, which repreſented the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:60246:238"/>token that they were the other Party engaged in the ſame Covenant. Thus our fore-named <hi>Primate,</hi> and ſeveral others underſtand it: and it carries ſome ſhow of probability in it. Yet I cannot think it unlikely, that it was ſprinkled upon the LXX. Elders, by whom the People conſented; if not upon all the People, who ſtood next to the Altar, and are here expreſly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> IX. 19. ſaith he ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Book,</hi> as well <hi>as the People:</hi> which is not here mentioned, but ſuppoſed. For when he went to ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the Blood, we muſt conceive he laid down the Book, that he might be at more liberty for this other action: And perhaps he laid it on one of the Pillars, where it was ſprinkled, as they were, together with the People whom they repreſented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid, Behold the Blood of the Covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all theſe words.</hi>] Look upon your ſelves as obliged by this Blood, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Commands which I have delivered to you, in the words you have heard. For there were two ways of making Covenants anciently; both which were here uſed. The <hi>first</hi> was, after a Sacrifice had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to ſprinkle the Blood of it upon both Parties, who were to be Confederates: which was done here <hi>v.</hi> 6, 8. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the Confederates thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to eat together ſome part of the Sacrifice; which follows <hi>v.</hi> 11. where we find the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who repreſented the People) did eat and drink in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Then went up</hi> Moſes, <hi>and</hi> Aaron, Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu, <hi>and LXX. of the Elders of</hi> Iſrael.] Theſe things being done, they went up into the Mount, as they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>i. e.</hi> they went up to that part of the Mount, where <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and the Elders were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come; but no further.</p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:60246:238"/>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And they ſaw the God of</hi> Iſrael.] When <hi>Moſes</hi> is commanded to come near unto the LORD, (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) <hi>Maimonides</hi> acknowledges it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his local approach to the place, where the <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>Glory of God</hi> then appeared, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 18. And therefore it is ſomething ſtrange, that he expounds the Elders <hi>ſeeing God,</hi> of their apprehenſion of him by their Underſtanding; and not rather of their beholding ſome glimpſe of that viſible Majeſty, which was on the Top of the Mount. For that, I doubt not, is the meaning, as appears by what follows. And ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> expounds it, <hi>They ſaw the Glory of the God of</hi> Iſrael; ſurrounded, we may well ſuppoſe, with an heavenly Hoſt of Angels, attending upon the SCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINAH, or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> as it was alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there was under his feet.</hi>] This hath made ſome conceive, that this viſible Glory appeared in the form of a Man, with his Back towards them, ſtanding upon a ſhining Pavement. But this is contrary to IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. For though that be ſpoken of another time and place, <hi>viz.</hi> the Giving of the Law, which all the People heard, but ſaw no Similitude; yet if the Elders had afterward ſeen a Similitude, it would have ſpoiled <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Argument, they being the Repreſentatives of the People. This glorious Light therefore, far ſurpaſſing all other, had no form, nor could be deſcribed by any Art: and conſequently by its <hi>feet,</hi> is meant only the lower part of it; which reſted, as it were, upon a moſt glorious Pavement. And thus the <hi>Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> is ſaid to have had a <hi>Foot-ſtool,</hi> (which was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Ark) though it had no Human ſhape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As it were a paved work of Saphire ſtone.</hi>] The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty of God was repreſented as having under it, a Pavement ſutable to it ſelf, very bright and ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:60246:239"/>For there is a ſort of <hi>Saphire,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſpotted with little points, or pricks of Gold, which ſhine like Stars interſperſed in the Body of it. See <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius in Solinum, p.</hi> 131, 203. Such was this Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we may gather from the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as it were the body of Heaven in its clearneſs.</hi>] As clear as the pureſt and ſereneſt Sky, when it is all ſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Stars. All which ſignifies, as I take it, that the Glory of the LORD appeared far above the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sun, in its greateſt brightneſs, upon a Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſparkling like the Stars in the Heaven, when it is moſt clear. The LXX. inſtead of the words, <hi>ſaw the God of</hi> Iſrael, have <hi>ſaw</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the place of the God of</hi> Iſrael. As if they ſaw a Throne, upon which there was a viſible Majeſty, beyond all deſcription. And if this be admitted, then this Throne may well be ſaid to have <hi>feet,</hi> ſtanding upon ſuch a glorious Pavement. And ſo they tranſlate it in the next Verſe, where this is repeated.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And upon the Nobles of the Children of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.] <hi>i. e.</hi> The Elders before-mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 9. called here <hi>Atzilim,</hi> to ſignifie that they were the prime and choiceſt Perſons among the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> For <hi>Atzal</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to ſeparate; and conſequently <hi>atzilim</hi> imports Men diſtinguiſhed from others, either by their Birth, Office or ſome excellent qualities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He laid not his hand.</hi>] Did not hurt them. Whereas it was the common Opinion, That they who ſaw God (though it was by one of his Angels) ſhould preſently die. The ſplendour of that glorious Light was ſo daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that it was a ſingular favour it did not put out their Eyes, as the Light wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, did his. We are told, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>The ſight of the Glory of the LORD was like devouring fire.</hi> Which might put them in fear perhaps, they had been ſcorched by it, when
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:60246:239"/>it flaſht out upon them; but they found not the leaſt hurt by it. Thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith in his Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the XXXII Chapter, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> delayed to come down from the Mount, the People fancied him to be burnt up by the fire, which ſhone from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, which there appeared.</p>
               <p>This ſight of God which he vouchſafed to the Elders, was in all likelyhood, to convince them that he was among them, and had ſpoken to them, and ſent them the Precepts before-mentioned by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo they ſaw God, and did eat and drink.</hi>] After they had ſeen God, they were ſo far from receiving any harm, that they feaſted with him upon the Reliques of the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> with great Joy and Gladneſs. Or we may ſuppoſe, that the Glory of the LORD ſhone upon them, as they ſat down to eat and drink, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their full conſent to the Covenant now made, (for ſo the cuſtom was of making Covenants, XXIV <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. XXXI. 54.) and that notwithſtanding they continued to finiſh their Feaſt, not being diſpirited (as good Men were ſometimes afterwards, with glorious Viſions, X <hi>Dan.</hi> 8, 16, 17.) but rather ſtrengthen'd and made more vigorous.</p>
               <p>The word for <hi>ſaw</hi> in this Verſe, is different from that in the former; importing, I ſuppoſe, that this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God to them laſted ſome time.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes.] He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, perhaps, with an audible voice, from the place where they ſaw his Glory; that they might know how familiar he was with God, and might more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive whatſoever Commands he brought from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come up to me into the Mount.</hi>] To the top of the Mount, where the Glory of the LORD was, <hi>v.</hi> 17. For hitherto <hi>Moſes</hi> had gone no further than the reſt;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:60246:240"/>but was with them when they did eat and drink before the LORD.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And a Law and Commandments which I have written.</hi>] From this place the Jews endeavour to eſtabliſh their <hi>unwritten</hi> or <hi>oral</hi> Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Traditions; which, they ſay, were now delivered, together with the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone. So <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Jad Chazeka;</hi>
                  <q>All the Precepts which were given to <hi>Moſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were given with their Explications;</q> according to what is ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>I will give the Tables of Stone, and a Law, and Commandments:</hi> where by the <hi>Law</hi> is meant the written Law, and the <hi>Commandments</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Explication of it, which we call the Oral Law.</q> Thus he, and others of them, directly againſt the Text it ſelf, which ſaith expreſly, both of the <hi>Law and the Commandments</hi> here mentioned, that they were <hi>written.</hi> See <hi>Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 16.

                  <hi>If any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</hi>] In all Cauſes, which were too hard for the Elders to determine, he directs them to go to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> as they were wont to do to him.

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>went into the midſt of the Cloud.</hi>] From whence the LORD had called to him, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Therefore he broke through the thick Cloud, into the very Prefence of God, which was in a ſecret part of the Cloud, called the <hi>midst of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And gat him up into the Mount.</hi>] To the top of it, where the Glory of the LORD appeared to him, in
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:60246:242"/>the midſt of the Cloud; the External Parts of which and the Fire only being ſeen by the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>was in the Mount forty days, and forty nights.</hi>] That he might receive the two Tables of Stone, and the Gift of Prophecy (as <hi>Elmacinus</hi> an Arabian Chriſtian adds) with Directions for the making the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and all things belonging to it, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be performed there, by the Prieſt, apparelled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Divine Preſcription, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which follow in the enſuing Chapters: where <hi>Moſes</hi> relates what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God gave him about every thing relating to his Divine Service. And it need not ſeem ſtrange, as <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> excellently ſpeaks (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Stromat. p.</hi> 351.) that <hi>Moſes</hi> received his Laws from God; when the Greeks pretend the ſame of their <hi>Minos:</hi> only they ſay he went into <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Cave, and was <hi>nine</hi> years there in learning the Laws which he gave him; when <hi>Moſes</hi> was but XL. days in the Mount, where God viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. They believed alſo that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> received his Laws from <hi>Apollo:</hi> and <hi>Zaleucus</hi> (as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and divers others, whom he mentions, ſay) received his from <hi>Minerva.</hi> All this was firmly believed among them, who in not acknowledging the Divinity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Miniſtration, were very ingrateful; for his was the <hi>Archetype,</hi> as he ſpeaks, or Pattern of what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in their Stories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forty days and forty nights.</hi>] It may be a queſtion, whether the ſix days, that he remained in the Cloud, before the LORD called him higher, be included in theſe XL. days; or were only preparatory to his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acceſs to God. They may well be both: for it is not ſaid, he was in the <hi>midst of the Cloud</hi> forty days and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights; but that he was ſo long <hi>in the Mount.</hi> Part of which time was ſpent in the dark Cloud; and the reſt in the bright Preſence of God, in the midſt of the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:60246:242"/>Cloud: And in all that ſpace, he did neither eat nor drink, XXXIV. 28. IX <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>God could, if he had pleaſed, have revealed to him all his Mind, in a leſs time: But the method of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom is to do all things gradually. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Subſtance of a Child in the Womb (ſaith the Author of <hi>Schalſch. Hakkabalah</hi>) is not perfected in leſs time than XL. Weeks, in all which time it receives no Meat nor Drink (at the Mouth we muſt underſtand him) and ſo many days did the Divine Power work in <hi>Moſes</hi> to form him into a new Eſſence, (as his words are) and give him a full Comprehenſion, of all that God communicated to him. And all this time he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did eat nor drink; for theſe actions (ſay that Jew) prejudice the Underſtanding; which God intended to exalt by depreſſing the Bodily Faculties and Powers. Which for want of Meat and Drink were brought down very low, that the Underſtanding might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and lifted up. And thus we find in after times, that <hi>Daniel</hi> chaſtened his Body, for <hi>three</hi> whole Weeks together, the better to diſpoſe him for heavenly Viſion, X. 2, 3, 12.</p>
               <p>This aſcent of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Cloudy part of the Mount, to the fiery top of it, was upon the XIVth of <hi>Sivan:</hi> and we may ſuppoſe, as <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> doth, that the Cloud accompanied him, as he went up, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from the circumambient flame.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An Offering.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Terumah</hi> (or as ſome pronounce it, <hi>Trumah</hi>) is commonly tranſlated an <hi>Heave-offering,</hi> or Offering lifted up. Which the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> tranſlates, <hi>that which is ſeparated</hi> from common uſe: and in the ſeparation, perhaps, was lifted up towards Heaven, in token that they deſired God to accept it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart, ye ſhall take my Offering.</hi>] They were only to be moved to it, but not importuned; much leſs told what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity they ſhould give: but every Man was left to his own good Inclinations. And accordingly <hi>Moſes</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Mind of God unto them, when he came down from the Mount; and they made a free Oblation, XXXV. 5, 21, 29. Beſides which, there was alſo a Tribute laid upon them for the ranſom of their Souls, XXX. 12, 13, 14. which amounted to a great Sum of Money, as we find in the XXXVIII. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And blue, and purple, and ſcarlet.</hi>] Wool, or Yarn, or Stuff, (or as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> will have it, Silk) of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:60246:243"/>theſe Colours. About which there is much diſpute: but no Tranſlation hath better deſcribed them than our <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For <hi>Thecelet,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>blue,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel</hi> will have to be a <hi>Sea-green,</hi> is certainly a <hi>Sky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour.</hi> So <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſſes it, the <hi>Colour of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament:</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> calls it <hi>ultramarine.</hi> This hath been demonſtrated by <hi>Braunius,</hi> who ſhows how it was died, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Veſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Argaman</hi> alſo he hath demonſtrated (<hi>c.</hi> 14.) ſignifies <hi>purple,</hi> as we tranſlate it. For both <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> ſay ſo; and he brings many proofs that they ſay true. And there being ſeveral ſorts of Purple, he ſhows this had in it the <hi>brighteſt and most ſtorid redneſs:</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dying, which he alſo there demonſtrates.

                  <hi>Tholaat-ſhani</hi> we alſo rightly tranſlate <hi>Scarlet,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Brannius</hi> ſhows, <hi>c.</hi> 15. of the fore-named Book.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abarbinel</hi> moſt abſurdly makes this to be the native colour of Silk, without any dye. See <hi>Bochart. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoic. P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>c.</hi> 27. <hi>p.</hi> 624.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And fine linen.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Scheſch</hi> ſignifies that pure fine linen, called <hi>Byſſus:</hi> So the <hi>Chaldee</hi> calls it <hi>butz.</hi> Which was peculiar to <hi>Egypt,</hi> as ſome fancy, where their Prieſts were clothed with it; and thence called <hi>linigeri.</hi> But <hi>Philoſtrutus</hi> ſaith there was a <hi>Byſſus</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> with which the better ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were clothed. And <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith it grew in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and in no other part of <hi>Greece.</hi> See <hi>Salmaſius Plin.

               <p>
                  <hi>And Goats-hair.</hi>] In the Hebrew there is only the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:60246:244"/>word <hi>izim,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Goats:</hi> but all Interpreters, by a common Ellipſis, underſtand it of their Hair. And <hi>Jarchi</hi> ſaith it ſignifies the <hi>flower</hi> of Goats-hair; or, as we ſpeak, <hi>the down;</hi> the very ſofteſt part of it. And no other Wool (as they call it) was accepted for the uſe of the Sanctuary (if we may credit <hi>Abarbinel</hi>) but only this. For the Wool of Lambs, and Sheep was vile in compariſon with this, which was precious in the Eaſtern Countries; where excellent Cloth was made of it, not inferiour to Silk in ſoftneſs and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as the ſame <hi>Braunius</hi> obſerves <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Veſtitu Sacr. Hebr. c.</hi> 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Badgers-skins.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Thecaſim,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Badgers</hi> (following thoſe who think <hi>Thacas</hi> to be the ſame with the Latin word <hi>Taxus</hi>) the ancient Interpreters take for <hi>a colour.</hi> And <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath at large endeavoured to prove that it ſignifies a kind of <hi>Violet</hi> or <hi>Purple</hi> Colour. So that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to offer <hi>red and violet Rams-skins.</hi> See <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Shittim-wood.</hi>] <hi>Kimchi</hi> ſaith this was the beſt kind of <hi>Cedar:</hi> But <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> takes it for the Wood of a Tree which grew in the Wilderneſs, not far from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in that place where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incamped, XXV <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. called <hi>Shittim</hi> from this Wood: unleſs the Wood were ſo called from the place where it grew. And thus St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſeems to have underſtood it. For he ſaith upon III <hi>Joel,</hi> that they were great Trees, which were not to be found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Countries, or in cultivated Places; but in the Deſert of <hi>Arabia</hi> only. Out of which very broad Boards might be cut, exceeding ſtrong, and of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:60246:244"/>ſmoothneſs and beauty. And upon XLI <hi>Iſa.</hi> he calls it <hi>Lignum imputribile,</hi> an incorruptible Wood (as the LXX. alſo here tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>five</hi> Verſes contain all the Materials which were to be uſed about the Sanctuary, and the Garments of the Prieſts who were to attend there. The only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, How they got ſuch things in the Wilderneſs? Some think they brought them with them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it is evident they did Gold, Silver, and Jewels. And <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks they alſo trafficked with the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People, while they remained here, of whom they bought Oyl, and Spices, and Shittim-wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is probable enough, every thing being to be had for Money, of which they brought good ſtore from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And let them make me a Sanctuary.</hi>] Now follow Directions for the making an Houſe for God, and every thing belonging to it. For ſo this place is ſometimes called, God's <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Habitation,</hi> becauſe there, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves, the SCHECHINAH, or Divine Majeſty, had its reſidence. And it is called a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or Holy Place, becauſe no uncircumciſed,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:60246:245"/>or unclean Perſon might enter into it. For under the Name of <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> is comprehended, as the Jews right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand it, all the Courts belonging to it, as well as the very Houſe it ſelf; with all the Utenſils, or Sacred Veſſels, which are afterward preſcribed for the Service of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I may dwell among them.</hi>] God reſolving to manifeſt himſelf, as, in a peculiar manner, conſtantly preſent among them, was pleaſed to order a Tent or Tabernacle to be built for him; wherein, while they ſojourned in Tents in the Wilderneſs, he dwelt among them in a viſible manner, by the SCHECHINAH, or <hi>Habitation of the Divinity,</hi> which was ſixed here; and was a ſpecial Type of God's future dwelling in Humane Nature. In ſhort, this <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes Nachmanides,</hi> wherein he dwelt as their King. And accordingly <hi>Schem Tob</hi> upon <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 40. pertinently obſerves, that God ordered all manner of things, belonging to a Palace, to be in this Houſe; particularly, Miniſters that conſtantly attended on him; a Table with daily Proviſion; all manner of Utenſils, ſuch as Pots, Spoons, Forks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Cloſet proper to himſelf alone; that the moſt Vulgar Underſtanding might conceive their King, the LORD of Hoſts, continually reſided there. And indeed the Hebrew word <hi>Mikdaſh,</hi> which we render <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies a <hi>Palace,</hi> XXVIII <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and ſo <hi>Kimchi</hi> interprets it upon VIII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among them.</hi>] In the Hebrew, <hi>in the midſt of them.</hi> For the Tabernacle, when it was erected, was placed in the midſt of their Camps, II <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. Which was the reaſon that all unclean Perſons were to be removed out of their Camp, leſt God, who dwelt in it, ſhould be offended by the pollution, V <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. And this is the reaſon why God is ſaid to <hi>walk among them</hi> (XXVI
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:60246:245"/>
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. XXII <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.) becauſe he dwelt in that Tent, which moved up and down, as they did while they dwelt in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>According to all that I ſhew thee, the pattern of the Tabernacle, and the pattern of all the Inſtruments thereof, ſo ſhalt thou make it.</hi>] This ſignifies that God ſhowed him a <hi>Model</hi> (as we now ſpeak) of the Houſe he was to make, and of all the things belonging to it: And accordingly he bid him rear it up, XXVI. 30. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Miſchpat,</hi> the <hi>Scheme</hi> or <hi>Draught</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Mount: which repreſented every thing ſo lively and diſtinctly, and in their juſt proportions to him, that he was the better able to make them. For things ſeen, and ſeen in all their Dimenſions, as <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binel</hi> obſerves, are more eaſily retained, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, than things that are only heard. And <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> had reaſon when he ſaid (<hi>de Vita Moſis, p.</hi> 181.) that God did not repreſent the Sanctuary to <hi>Moſes</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Picture, much leſs give him an <hi>Idea</hi> of it only in his Mind; but ſet before him a <hi>Structure</hi> which he ſhould imitate. For ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Tabnit</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>pattern</hi>) ſignifies a <hi>Structure,</hi> or Building; which cannot be better expreſſed than by the word <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> which he now ſaw of the Houſe he was to erect. Thus <hi>Maimonides</hi> explains this word, in diſtinction from <hi>Temunah,</hi> which ſignifies only the <hi>reſemblance</hi> of a thing; whereas <hi>Tabnit</hi> ſignifies the <hi>ſtructure,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith he, its form; whether it be in a Square, or Circle, or Triangle, or any other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; and he quotes this place for it, and <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Which confutes the Fancy of thoſe, who will have <hi>Moſes</hi> to have framed this Houſe, and all belonging to it, according to the faſhion of ſuch things, which he had ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were in uſe among other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:60246:246"/>unto whoſe Religion, he deſigned to make his as conformable, as might be ſafely allowed. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly made this Tabernacle to be carried on the Prieſt's Shoulders, as the Tabernacle of <hi>Moloch</hi> was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems to me to be further from the intention of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather from the Directions which God here gives him, than this Conceit. He had a more Divine Guide than the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and made things by a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Pattern,</hi> and not according to their <hi>Modes.</hi> The Jews were ſo poſſeſſed with this Opinion, that when the Temple came to be built inſtead of this Tabernacle, they ſay it was done by conſulting the Oracle, and by the Solemn Decree of the King, and of the great <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> and of the Prophets. For which they alledge this very place, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves out of the <hi>Miſna</hi> and <hi>Maimonides,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</p>

For herein was put his moſt precious Treaſure, thoſe Divine Records, the two Tables of Stone, wrote with his own Finger, called <hi>the Tables of Teſtimony,</hi> XXXI. 18. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were the Teſtimony of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> whereby he teſtified his Will, and they their Obedience to it. Whence the Ark it ſelf is called <hi>the Ark of the Teſtimony,</hi> XXX. 6.

Inches. But one that hath taken a great deal of pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſuch things (Dr. <hi>Cumberland,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburgh</hi>) hath in a very Learned Diſcourſe, about the <hi>Scripture Meaſures,</hi> given ſtrong Reaſons to incline us to think that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cubit were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout XXI. Inches. And if they had not been ſo, the Table (which is deſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 23.) would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, being but three quarters of a yard high, <hi>i. e.</hi> 27 Inches (according to the common Notion of a <hi>Cubit</hi>) which is too low for a Table. Whereas accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his account, it was about <hi>Thirty two Inches,</hi> which is a very convenient height for a Table. See Ch. II.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And thou ſhalt overlay it with pure gold.</hi>] Not meerly gild it, but lay it over with thin Plates of Gold; for if they had been thick, it would, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> notes, have been too heavy to carry. Thus we ſee Cheſts now ſometimes plated with Iron, in ſome parts of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within and without.</hi>] So that nothing but Gold could be ſeen, whether it were ſhut or open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhalt make upon it a Crown of Gold round about.</hi>] A Border or Liſt of Gold went round at the top of it; which was call'd a Crown, becauſe it compaſſed every part of it: but was of another figure, not round, but ſquare, as the Ark was. It was of great uſe, as well as ornament, for the better ſetling the Propitiatory upon the Ark, that it might not ſlip off, but be kept up firmly by this Border going round about the top of the Ark. And it
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:60246:247"/>might the better be called a <hi>Crown,</hi> becauſe it was of ſome height, for the ſurer ſupporting of the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper here to obſerve, that as the ancient Crowns were only a plain Circle of Gold, or other thing, ſo they were ſet upon the Heads of none but their Gods, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> XVI. <hi>c.</hi> 4. who ſays there that <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the firſt that put a Crown upon his Head, which was made of <hi>Ivy.</hi> Certain it is, that God requires thoſe things, which were peculiarly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to him and his Service to be crowned, as a Mark of their excellency: which were four only; this Crown upon the Ark, and that upon the Golden Table (<hi>v.</hi> 24. of this Chapter) and upon the Altar of Incenſe, XXX. 3. and on the Head of the High Prieſt, XXIX. 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And thou ſhalt cast four rings of Gold for it.</hi>] Which were of maſſy Gold, we muſt ſuppoſe, becauſe the Ark was carried by ſtaves put into theſe rings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And put them in the four corners thereof.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Paamoth</hi> comes from <hi>Paam,</hi> which never ſignifies a <hi>corner,</hi> in the whole Scripture; but always a <hi>foot,</hi> or <hi>baſis,</hi> or <hi>ſtep,</hi> as <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> notes. Which hath made ſome think, the Ark had Feet to ſtand upon (ſuch <hi>round knobs</hi> as now our Cheſts and Boxes many times have) though the Scripture do not mention them. But we are not to make Conjectures out of our own Heads; which ſome have carried ſo far, as to fancy there were Wheels in theſe Feet, for the Ark to run upon, which made it God's <hi>Chariot</hi> wherein he rode. But who ever heard of a Chariot carried on Men's ſhoulders? Therefore <hi>Nach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manides</hi> more reaſonably conceives, that theſe Rings were indeed in the corners of the Ark, but not in the higher (as <hi>R. Solomon</hi> would have them) but in the lower; and therefore ſaid here to be in <hi>the feet.</hi> For the Scripture calling the top of every thing, <hi>the head</hi> of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:60246:247"/>it; the bottom is commonly there called <hi>the feet:</hi> And ſo the Ark (by placing the Rings and Staves in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) was carried on high upon the Prieſts ſhoulders, repreſenting God <hi>who is highly exalted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And two rings ſhall be on the one ſide of it, and two rings on the other ſide of it.</hi>] That is, in the length of it (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſly teſtifies) and not in the breadth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And thou ſhalt make ſtaves of Shittim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi>] Of ſuch a length, that the Ark might be at a decent diſtance from thoſe that carried it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And overlay them with Gold.</hi>] With Plates of Gold, as the Ark it ſelf was <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And thou ſhalt put the ſtaves into the rings, by the ſides of the Ark.</hi>] The Hebrews ſay theſe ſtaves were ten Cubits long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Ark may be born with them.</hi>] Upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Levites, particularly the Sons of <hi>Korah.</hi> See <hi>Numb.</hi> IV. 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VII. 9. For it was a Crime to carry it any other way, either in their Hands, or drawn in a Cart. Compare 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XIII. 7. with XV. 15.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And the ſtaves ſhall be in the rings of the Ark.</hi>] Continue and remain in the Rings, whence they were once put therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall not be taken from it.</hi>] When they ſet down the Ark, they were not to take out the <hi>ſtaves,</hi> and put them in again, when it was to be carried; but let them, as was ſaid, continue in the rings: that there might be no danger of letting them fall (which had been a great irreverence) and becauſe they would be beſt preſerved, and take leſs harm there, than any where elſe; and if they had occaſion to remove the Ark ſuddenly all would be ready; and the Levites were hereby kept from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ark, or coming nearer to it, than the ends of the ſtaves.</p>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:60246:248"/>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And thou ſhalt put into the Ark, the teſtimony, which I will give thee.</hi>] The two Tables of Stone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Ten Commandments, which are called <hi>the Teſtimony,</hi> and the <hi>Two Tables of Teſtimony</hi> (XXXI. 18.) becauſe they teſtified what the Will of God was, which they had conſented to obſerve; and were therefore publick authentick Inſtruments atteſting the Covenant between God and them. Whence the Ark, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe, is called <hi>the Ark of the Teſtimony</hi> (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>v.</hi> 22. and in a great many other places of the XL Chapter. And in one place it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Teſtimony,</hi> XXX. 36. and <hi>the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD,</hi> X <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. becauſe then <hi>Ten words</hi> were the principal part of the Covenant, to which they ſtood obliged. And perhaps the Book of the Covenant which <hi>Moſes</hi> made with them (XXIV. 7.) is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>the Teſtimony.</hi> For though we read in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> VIII. 9. <hi>there was nothing in the Ark ſave the two Tables of Stone,</hi> &amp;c. yet the Apoſtle mentions ſome other things that were not <hi>in,</hi> yet <hi>by</hi> or <hi>before</hi> the Ark, IX <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. But I aſſert nothing in this matter. And ſhall only further obſerve, that this direction, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Teſtimony (or Tables of Stone) into the Ark, is given before any order is taken, for making a Covering to it, which follows after. And therefore he was to put in the Law before the Cover was ſet on. For though <hi>v.</hi> 21. this be mentioned again, and put after the Cover is named, yet the meaning is, that he ſhould ſet on the Cover, having put in the Law. And it is repeated, that he ſhould be very careful of this, becauſe the Cherubims were to protect and defend it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And thou ſhalt make a Mercy-ſeat.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Capporet</hi> litterally ſignifies <hi>a Covering</hi> of any thing: And that is the proper ſignification of this
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:60246:248"/>
                  <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> (as we tranſlate it) which was the Covering of the Ark. For it had no Door, but was open at the top; ſo that they might put the Tables of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into it, and then it was to be faſtned above by this Cover; which any one may diſcern by its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was exactly fit for it.</p>
               <p>Others will have it called <hi>Capporet,</hi> not from <hi>Capar,</hi> to <hi>cover;</hi> but from <hi>Cipper,</hi> to <hi>expiate,</hi> and render pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious. And ſo indeed the Apoſtle calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the propitiatory;</hi> becauſe God here ſhowed himſelf to be propitious, and appeaſed by the Blood of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which was ſprinkled before this place. But the reaſon of this Tranſlation may be, becauſe when Sins are pardoned, they are ſaid in Scripture <hi>to be covered.</hi> The LXX. put both theſe together in their Tranſlation, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of pure Gold.</hi>] Not of Wood cruſted over with Gold; but all (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſpeaks) of ſolid Gold; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the Cover of the Ark, in which were the Tables of the Covenant written with God's Finger, than which nothing was more precious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two cubits and an half ſhall be the length thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] Which was the length of the Ark, <hi>v.</hi> 10. as <hi>the breadth was a Cubit and a half,</hi> both of that and this. Which ſhows this was the Cover of the Ark, being moſt exactly adapted to it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And thou ſhalt make two Cherubims of gold.</hi>] We read of <hi>Cherubims</hi> in the beginning of the World; and have good reaſon to believe thereby is meant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. See III <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. But in what ſhape they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared we are not told, nor is there the leaſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it here in this place, but what we can gather from <hi>v.</hi> 20. So that I can only ſay this, they were of ſuch a ſhape as the Angelical Miniſters appeared in, which attended upon the Divine Majeſty in the Mount; or
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:60246:249"/>rather ſuch as god ſhowed <hi>Moſes</hi> a <hi>pattern</hi> of, whereby to repreſent theſe heavenly Miniſters. For both the Ark, and all belonging to it, were made according to the <hi>model</hi> God gave him; not from any <hi>Egyptian</hi> pattern, as ſome imagine. <hi>Bochart</hi> ſeems to me to ſpeak judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, when he ſaith, they were not <hi>Figures</hi> of Angels, but rather <hi>Emblems</hi> whereby the Angelical Nature was in ſome ſort expreſſed, <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 25. And were therefore ordered to be made, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, that the Jews might be confirmed in the belief of the Exiſtence of Angels, which is the <hi>ſecond Article</hi> of their Faith, next to the belief of God. And he commanded <hi>two</hi> to be made; becauſe if there had been but one, it might have led them into a dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that this was the Figure of God, whereby they might have been inclined to worſhip it. But there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>two</hi> of them ordered, with this Declaration, <hi>the LORD our God, is one God,</hi> it led them into right thoughts, that God had many of theſe Angelical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.

               <p>
                  <hi>Of beaten work ſhalt thou make them.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Miksheh,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>beaten work,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that both of them ſhould be made out of the ſame piece of Gold, that made the Cover of the Ark; ſo as to be one continued work with that, not ſeparate from it. This appears to be true from the next Verſe, <hi>Min hacapporet; out of the Mercy-ſeat ſhall ye make the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi> &amp;c. or, <hi>from the Mercy-ſeat</hi> ſhall they proceed, on the two ends of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And make one Cherub on the one end, and the other Cherub on the other end.</hi>] This looks like a <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abarbinel</hi>) it being ſaid in the foregoing words, <hi>in the two ends of the Mercy-ſeat:</hi> but it is far from it; being a Declaration (as he takes it) that the <hi>Cherubims</hi> ſhould not be placed both on one ſide of the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:60246:249"/>Ark; nor ſo, as not to be oppoſite one to the other: but one on one ſide, and the other on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even of the Mercy-ſeat, ſhall ye make the Cherubims, on the two ends thereof.</hi>] They were not to be made ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Mercy-ſeat, and afterwards joyned to it, but to be made <hi>out of it,</hi> ſo as to be one piece with it, (as was ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 18.) Which in the execution of this Command appears very plainly, XXXVII. 8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And the Cherubims ſhall ſtretch forth their wings on high.</hi>] This ſhows they were made like flying Creatures; but had not the Reſemblance of any Fowl, that we know. So <hi>Joſephus,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And put the rings in the four corners, that are on the four feet thereof.</hi>] The Hebrew word here for <hi>Corners</hi> always hath that ſignification; being quite different from that word which is uſed <hi>v.</hi> 12. when he ſpeaks of the Ark. Which may well incline us to <hi>Joſephus</hi> his opinion, that theſe rings were not below, as they were in the Ark, but on the upper part of the Feet of the Table; ſo that it was not carried up on high, as the Ark was, but
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:60246:251"/>hung down between the Prieſts on whoſe ſhoulders the ſtaves reſted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Over against the border ſhall the rings be,</hi> &amp;c.] Juſt below the <hi>Border</hi> and the <hi>Cornice</hi> before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>v.</hi> 25.) were theſe rings to be placed; as the Border and its <hi>Cornice</hi> were placed below the upper <hi>Crown</hi> (or Cornice) which compaſſed the top of the Table, <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For places of the ſtaves to bear the Table.</hi>] This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the uſe of the rings.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the ſtaves of Shittim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and overlay them with gold.</hi>] Such as were made for the carriage of the Ark, <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Table may be born with them.</hi>] By the Prieſts upon their ſhoulders. For the Tabernacle being a moveable Houſe, there was frequent occaſions, as they journeyed from one place to another, to carry this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble along with them, as they did all other things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>It is not ordered that the Staves ſhould remain in the Rings, as they did in thoſe belonging in the Ark (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) becauſe they might have been an hindrance to the Prieſts in their Miniſtration at this Table every day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is likely, they were laid up in ſome place near it, and put in when they travelled, as they were ordered to be, IV <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the diſhes thereof.</hi>] It is not eaſie to give an account, either of the form, or of the uſe of theſe <hi>Keharoth,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Diſhes,</hi> i. e. <hi>Patins,</hi> whereon to put the Bread, which were XII. Loaves, XXIV <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. and the Frankincenſe which was to be ſet upon each row of Loaves, <hi>v.</hi> 7. This is a plain ſenſe, if the Loaves ſtood upon <hi>Diſhes,</hi> and not immediately upon the Table, as <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> thinks they did. And therefore imagines they
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:60246:252"/>were full of fine flour of which the Bread was made; or with Oyl, which was to be mingled and uſed in their Sacrifices. But this is more unlikely than the other, the flour not being kept here in the holy place, but in the outward Court: And his reaſon for it is not ſolid; which is, That the Heads of their Tribes offered every one of them a ſilver <hi>Charger</hi> (ſo we render the ſame word we here tranſlate a <hi>Diſh,</hi> VII <hi>Numb.</hi>) full of fine flour mingled with Oyl. But thoſe were not for the uſe of this Table, on which ſuch large Diſhes or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers could not ſtand, there being no room for them. Therefore at laſt he fancies them to have been <hi>Salt-cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> which were ſet upon the Table together with the Bread, being uſed at all meals. And <hi>Philo,</hi> as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, ſeems to be of this opinion, who ſpeaking of this Table (in his Third Book <hi>of the Life of</hi> Moſes) ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſpoons thereof.</hi>] If this be a true interpretation of the Hebrew word <hi>Cappoth,</hi> their uſe was to put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe into the Diſhes, and to take it out: for that they contained incenſe, is evident from VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 14, 20, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which makes the fore-named Author think this word ſhould rather be rendred <hi>Vials,</hi> which <hi>Pollux</hi> numbers among the Sacred Veſſels; and it is plain were uſed in offering Incenſe in the Temple: for St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the XXIV. Elders, having <hi>every one of them golden Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als full of Odours,</hi> or Incenſe, V <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. whence it is the LXX. tranſlate this word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:60246:252"/>But <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> indeavours at large to prove that the Hebrew word <hi>keſoth</hi> is rightly tranſlated by the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

The manner being, firſt to throw Frankincenſe into the Fire on the Altar, then to pour out the Wine, and then the Sacrifice was ſlain. In which order <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> report it, as <hi>Cuperus</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis Homeri, p.</hi> 71.

               <p>
                  <hi>And bowls thereof.</hi>] So St. <hi>Hierom</hi> underſtands the Hebrew word <hi>menakioth,</hi> which, following the LXX. he tranſlates <hi>cyathos:</hi> the form of which <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> (in his fore-named Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 44.) hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make out, and eſtabliſh this as the certain meaning of the word. But it is very hard to tell of what uſe they were here, where no Drink was uſed: and yet our Marginal Tranſlation of the next word ſeems to favour it, making theſe <hi>to pour out withal.</hi> And indeed the Hebrew word ſignifies both to <hi>cover</hi> and to <hi>pour out.</hi> But the former ſeems moſt proper here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we take theſe to have been <hi>Bowls</hi> (or ſuch like Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels)
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:60246:253"/>ſet here meerly to ſignifie more compleatly, that God kept Houſe among them, (as we ſpeak) they being part of the Furniture of a Table.</p>
               <p>Others think they were Stands, upon which the Diſhes of Bread were ſet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To cover withal.</hi>] If we allow of this Tranſlation, and it relate to the word <hi>Bowls</hi> immediately preceeding, then it ſignifies theſe Veſſels were a larger ſort of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Or it may refer to the whole; that all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Veſſels were made to cover the Table intirely. But the Marginal Tranſlation being alſo agreeable to the Hebrew Text, it may poſſibly declare the uſe of the fore-named Veſſels, which was <hi>to pour out withal.</hi> For in their <hi>Libamina</hi> there were ſeveral ſorts of theſe Veſſels uſed among the Gentiles; one only to taſte the Wine before the Sacrifice, which <hi>Scacchus</hi> thinks was that the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Simpulum:</hi> another to pour it upon the Sacrifice when it was offered, which they call'd <hi>Guttus,</hi> becauſe it had a narrow mouth out of which the Wine came out by little and little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of pure gold ſhalt thou make them.</hi>] All things in this part of the Houſe were of Gold, that the Royal Palace of their King might be moſt ſumptuouſly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſutable to the greatneſs of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet upon the Table Shew-bread.</hi>] In the Hebrew, <hi>Bread of the Face,</hi> or <hi>Preſence;</hi> becauſe it was ſet before the Ark of the Covenant where God was preſent. The forementioned <hi>Fort.

And there were XII. of them in all, repreſenting the XII. Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe Offering theſe were to God, whoſe Miniſters are them in the Holy Place, XXIV <hi>Lev.</hi> 5, 7, 8, 9. They were ſet in <hi>two rows,</hi> one piled upon another, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> repreſents them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Maimonides</hi> wrote his <hi>More Nevochim,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes (<hi>P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) to that day he was ignorant of the reaſon of this Table, and the Bread continually upon it. Which is very ſtrange, when at the beginning of theſe Directions, God had declared, he would have an Houſe built, that he might dwell among them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. which <hi>dwelling</hi> among them, was admirably repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by its having in it all things belonging to a <hi>Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houſe,</hi> particularly a <hi>Table</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> (ſignifying all Proviſion) whereby they were made to underſtand, that God, as was ſaid before, kept Houſe among them. Which no Body hath explained ſo well, as an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Writer of our own, Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe put out long ago, concerning <hi>the Right Notion of the Lord's Supper, cap.</hi> 6. where he obſerves out of <hi>Nachman,</hi> That there was a Table and a Candleſtick ordered for this Houſe, becauſe they were the ordinary Furniture of a Room. For which reaſon, the Table had its <hi>Diſhes, Spoons, Bowls,</hi> and <hi>Covers</hi> (though they were never uſed) and was always furniſhed with Bread upon it; as the Candleſtick alſo had Lamps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning. From hence it was likewiſe that there was a continual Fire, in this dwelling of God, upon his Altar. And, to carry on the Notion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſtant Meat and Proviſion brought to it, by the Sacrifices there offered. Which were partly conſumed by Fire upon God's own Altar; and partly eaten by
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:60246:254"/>the Prieſts, who were God's Domeſtick Servants, and therefore to be maintained by him. And beſides the fleſh of the Beaſts offered up in Sacrifice, there was a <hi>Mincha</hi> or <hi>Meat-offering</hi> made of Flour and Oyl; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a <hi>Drink-offering,</hi> which were ever joyned with the daily Burnt-Sacrifice, being the Bread and the Drink which were to go along with God's Meat. So the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are called in the firſt of <hi>Malachi.</hi> It was alſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, as we read in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> that <hi>Salt</hi> ſhould accompany every Sacrifice and Oblation; becauſe it was not ſit, as the ſame <hi>Nachman</hi> obſerves, that God's Meat ſhould be unſavoury. And all theſe were to be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the Altar only, by the holy Fire which came down from Heaven, becauſe they were God's Portion, and therefore to be conſumed by himſelf, in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner.</p>
               <p>There are thoſe of the Jews, who look upon this Bread ſet on God's Table, as an acknowledgment that they received their Food from God. And we may add, that this Bread being made of the ſame Corn, which they eat of themſelves, it ſtill farther repreſented to them, that they were God's <hi>Convivae;</hi> who continually entertained them with that Proviſion which was made for him.</p>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt make me a Tabernacle.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Miſchean</hi> properly ſignifies a place to dwell in; an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation (according to what was ſaid XXV. 8.) For this was the place of the SCHECHINAH (which comes from the ſame root with <hi>Miſchcan</hi>) which dwelt here as in its Houſe. But it is commonly tranſlated a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> only to ſignifie what kind of <hi>dwelling</hi> it was, <hi>viz.</hi> a portable Houſe, as <hi>Philo</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Of cunning work ſhalt thou make them.</hi>] There were two ſorts of Work more Artificial than ordinary: the one called <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> (which is that here mentioned)
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:60246:256"/>the other <hi>Rokem,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>needle Work.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was the moſt excellent; for it was done by weaving, and had figures on both ſides: whereas that by Needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work had only on one ſide, as <hi>Jarchi</hi> here notes. Who ſays there was, ſuppoſe the figure of a Lion on one ſide, and of an Eagle on the other: or rather, he ſhould have ſaid, the ſame figure appeared on both ſides, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſeems to take it, in his <hi>Kele Hammikdah, c.</hi> 8.
<q>Whereſoever any Work is called <hi>Rokem</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is to be underſtood of Figures which are made only on one ſide of the Web: but the Work called <hi>Choſcheb</hi> had ſigures on both ſides, before and behind.</q> See XXVIII. 39.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>The length of one Curtain ſhall be eight and twenty Cubits,</hi> &amp;c.] Every one of theſe Curtains was fourteen yards long, and two yards broad: for a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit was half a yard of our meaſure, according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eſtimation. It was ſome Inches more, as I have obſerved on XXV. 10. but to make the Reader more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily comprehend it, I ſhall not exactly compute the length and breadth of theſe Curtains, but follow the Vulgar Opinion. And with theſe, it will appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, both the Roof of the Tabernacle was covered, and the ſides of it likewiſe, almoſt down to the ground, that is, within a Cubit of it, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, and as may be made out from the Text: the Tabernacle (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Notion of a <hi>Cubit</hi>) being <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> yards long, <hi>five</hi> yards broad, and as many yards high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every one of the Curtains ſhall have one meaſure.</hi>] Be exactly of the ſame length and breadth.</p>

<pb n="506" facs="tcp:60246:257"/>yards broad) was made two large pieces of Tapeſtry; each of them <hi>fourteen</hi> yards long, and <hi>ten</hi> yards broad. With one of theſe pieces of Tapeſtry the <hi>Holy Place</hi> was covered, it being juſt ſo many yards broad as that place was long; ſo that it did not come down before at the Eaſt-end, which was the Entrance of the Sanctuary. The other piece of Tapeſtry covered <hi>the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:</hi> which being but five yards long, one half of this piece hung down behind it at the Weſt-end, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſilver Baſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be one Tabernacle.</hi>] By this Union the Covering of the Tabernacle ſhall be, as if it were one intire piece.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And thou ſhalt make.</hi>] Now he gives Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about the outward part of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Curtains of Goats hair.</hi>] Though a ſoft kind of Cloath was made of Goats hair, yet in compariſon with the other, it was a courſer ſort of Covering, to be laid over
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:60246:257"/>the finer before-mentioned, for their preſervation and ſheltering from the Weather. The old <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Scenitae,</hi> made their Tents of Goats Hair; for <hi>Solinus</hi> calls them <hi>Cilicina,</hi> which he interprets <hi>Caprarum pilis texta.</hi> Concerning the word we tranſlate <hi>Goats hair,</hi> ſee XXV. 4.</p>

And ſo it is to be underſtood here, where a ſecond Covering is ordered to be thrown over the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleven Curtains ſhalt thou make.</hi>] There was one more of theſe Camlet Curtains (as I may call them) than of the Tapeſtry, which were but <hi>ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the length of one Curtain ſhall be thirty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</hi>] As there was one Curtain more of theſe, ſo they were one yard longer than the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the breadth of one Curtain four Cubits.</hi>] This was the breadth of the former <hi>v.</hi> 2. (where ſee what a <hi>Cubit</hi> was) but there being one Curtain more of theſe than of the other, they were two yards broader than them, when they were all joyned together. Inſomuch that they both came down lower than the other, on either ſide, half a yard; and alſo hung down a yard before the entrance of the Tabernacle, which the former did not cover at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt couple five Curtains by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſix Curtains by themſelves.</hi>] They were to be coupled together after the ſame manner as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that they might make two large pieces: but there being <hi>eleven</hi> Curtains in all, there were but <hi>five</hi> in one piece, and <hi>ſix</hi> in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall double the ſixth Curtain in the fore-front of the Tabernacle.</hi>] The meaning ſeems to be, that he ſhould
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:60246:258"/>turn up that part of the Curtain, which hung down at the entrance of the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And thou ſhalt make fifty loops,</hi> &amp;c.] This may be ſufficiently underſtood by what was ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Loops of the other Covering, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And thou ſhalt make fifty taches of braſs,</hi> &amp;c.] The two great pieces of the inner Hangings, being the richer, were coupled together with Claſps of Gold, (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) but theſe, being coarſer, only with Claſps of Braſs. Which did not lye directly over the the Golden, but, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> obſerves, were three quarters of a yard more Weſtward: theſe two large pieces, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an equal bigneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And couple the Tent together.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Theſe outward Hangings or <hi>Covering</hi> (as we tranſlate the word <hi>Ohel,</hi> v. 7.) of the Tent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it may be one.</hi>] That the two pieces may be knit together by the Loops and Claſps into one. See <hi>v.</hi> 6. where this place is there called <hi>Miſchean (dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)</hi> which is here called <hi>ohel;</hi> to ſhow more clearly what kind of dwelling it was; an ambulatory Houſe, ſuch as Shepherds have, which they remove from place to place, IV <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the remnant that remaineth of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Tent, the half Curtain that remaineth, ſhall hang over the backſide of the Tabernacle.</hi>] Theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Curtains being four Cubits, that is, two yards and more broader than the inward, they hung down above a yard lower than the other on the <hi>backſide</hi> (or Weſt-part) of the Tabernacle, as they did on the Front or Entrance (I obſerved before <hi>v.</hi> 8.) which was on the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And a Cubit on the one ſide, and a Cubit on the other ſide of that which remaineth in the length of the Curtains of the Tent, it ſhall hang over the ſides of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:60246:258"/>&amp;c.] Theſe outward Curtains being a yard (as two Cubits are commonly eſteemed) longer than the inward, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 8. they hung down therefore on either ſide a Cubit, that is, half a yard lower than the inward did. And yet they did not come quite to the ground, but the foundation of the Tabernacle, which was of Silver, might be ſeen round about, ſave only at the Weſt-end.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And thou ſhalt make a covering for the Tent of Rams skins, died red.</hi>] This was a <hi>third</hi> Covering, to be laid over the other two, to keep them from wet. It is not ſaid of what dimenſions it was, which hath made ſome fancy it covered only the Roof. But it is far more reaſonable to think it was as large as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Covering of Goats hair; which might have been ſpoiled by Rain and Duſt, if the ſides had not been defended as well as the roof. Concerning theſe <hi>Rams skins</hi> ſee XXV. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a covering above.</hi>] That is a <hi>fourth</hi> Covering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of Rams skins, for the greater Security of the two inmoſt Hangings; which had need of all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, eſpecially on the Roof; becauſe it was flat, and conſequently the Rain was more likely to ſoak into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Badgers skins.</hi>] I obſerved on XXV. 5. that all the ancient Interpreters take <hi>Thachas</hi> for a Colour, and not for a Badger, or any other Animal. For which there is this conſiderable Argument, which I did not there mention; That when God ſets forth his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Kindneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as his beloved Spouſe, and ſhows, in many magnificent Expreſſions, how richly he adorned her, he ſaith among other things, that he <hi>ſhod her with THACAS,</hi> which we tranſlated <hi>Badgers skins;</hi> of which the meaneſt People never made any uſe for Shoes: And therefore <hi>Bochartus</hi> rightly concludes
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:60246:259"/>it ſignifies ſomething of greater value, <hi>viz.</hi> Rams skins died of a kind of Purple colour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt make boards for the Tabernacle.</hi>] Or <hi>Planks,</hi> which were the Walls of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Shittim-wood.</hi>] See XXV. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Standing up.</hi>] Erect upon one end; and not lying ſide-ways.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Ten Cubits ſhall be the length of a board.</hi>] By this it appears the Houſe (according to the Vulgar O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a <hi>Cubit</hi>) was but five yards in height. See <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a Cubit and an half ſhall be the breadth of one board.</hi>] Three quarters broad; by which, compared with <hi>v.</hi> 18. it will appear how long the Houſe was.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Two tenons ſhall there be in one board,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew calls them <hi>hands;</hi> becauſe they were ſo made, as to take faſt hold of the Sockets mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Set in order one against another.</hi> They were in each corner of every Plank, at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And thou ſhalt make,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>twenty boards on the ſouth ſide, ſouthward.</hi>] By this it appears the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was <hi>thirty</hi> Cubits, that is (according to common eſtimation) fifteen yards long; each of theſe twenty Boards being three quarters of a yard broad. But this ſeems not to be magnificent enough; and therefore it is more reaſonable to follow their Computation, who think the Jewiſh Cubit, was <hi>three Inches</hi> and more lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than our <hi>half yard.</hi> Which makes the Tabernacle near half as big again, both in length and height, than it is commonly deſcribed. See XXV. 10.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And thou ſhalt make forty ſockets of ſilver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the twenty boards,</hi> &amp;c.] There were two ſilver Sockets for each Plank, whoſe Tenons ſinking into theſe Mortaiſes, the middle of the Planks ſetled upon theſe
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:60246:259"/>
                  <hi>Baſes,</hi> as the Foundation of the Houſe. For ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Adon</hi> imports; ſignifying that which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports another thing which ſtands upon it. And theſe ſeem to have been ſo large, that two <hi>Sockets</hi> were as long as each Plank was broad, that is, three quarters of a yard; and being joyned cloſe together, they made one intire Foundation, though conſiſting of ſeveral pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And for the ſecond ſide of the Tabernacle on the north ſide, there ſhall be twenty boards.</hi>] This Verſe, and the next, only direct that the North ſide of the Tabernacle ſhould be anſwerable to the South.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And for the ſides of the Tabernacle weſtward.</hi>] The Hebrew word we tranſlate <hi>ſides,</hi> ſhould rather be tranſlated <hi>ends.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt make ſix boards.</hi>] Of the ſame breadth with the other, which made them four yards and an half, according to the Vulgar notion of a <hi>Cubit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto there is no direction about the Entrance, or Eaſt-end; which is reſerved till the laſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And two boards ſhalt thou make for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Tabernacle in the two ſides.</hi>] Beſides the ſix Planks before-mentioned, there was a Plank at each corner, which joyned the end of the Tabernacle and the two ſides together; and made the whole Building ſtronger and more ſtedfaſt. How broad they were, he doth not tell us; but I ſuppoſe only large enough to make the Weſt-end five yards broad, that is, each of them <hi>half a Cubit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:60246:260"/>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And they ſhall be coupled together beneath, and they ſhall be coupled together above the head of it, unto one ring,</hi> &amp;c.] To make all more firm, theſe two cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Planks (for of them he ſeems here to ſpeak) were to be knit to the other Planks, both at the top and at the bottom, with a golden Link. Some think every Plank was thus linkt to the next (whence they are here called <hi>Twins</hi>) for the ſtrengthning the whole Fabrick: but if this be true, it is not clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And they ſhall be eight boards, and their ſock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus there were eight Planks in all at the Weſt-end, (<hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.) whoſe Tenons ſtruck into the Mortaiſes of ſixteen ſilver Baſes. See <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And thou ſhalt make bars of Shittim-wood.</hi>] Beſides the Links of Gold which held the boards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the top and at the bottom; there were alſo wooden Bars, which run into Staples of Gold, which were faſtned in every Plank, as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Five for the boards of the one ſide of the Tabernacle.</hi>] There were five of theſe Bars on each ſide, <hi>v.</hi> 27. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Planks were held tight together. Of what length they were, is not here ſaid; but <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, they were each five Cubits.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And five bars for the boards of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the two ſides weſtward.</hi>] Beſides thoſe on the North and South ſide (mentioned in the latter end of <hi>v.</hi> 26. and the beginning of this) there were five at the Weſt-end. For ſo it ſhould be tranſlated, not the <hi>two ſides</hi> (for there was but one) but the <hi>two ends;</hi> that is, the two Corners at the Weſt part of the Tabernacle, which was much ſtrengthned by theſe Bars. Or the Plural Number (as is uſual) is put for the Singular; this being the end wherein two ſides terminated.</p>

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And the middle bar.</hi>] This ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that the other <hi>four</hi> were at the top, and at the bottom; and this in the midſt of the Planks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the midst of the boards, ſhall reach from end to end.</hi>] The Hebrew Doctors, whom Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> follows, take this as if it ſignified that this Bar went through the very Planks, which were bored in the midſt. But then the Planks muſt have been of ſuch a thickneſs, as would have made them leſs portable, than this Tabernacle ſeems to have been; for they would have been Timber rather than Planks. I take it therefore that this was a long Bar, which <hi>reached from end to end,</hi> and went through Staples, which were in the middle of the Planks, as the other did above and below. The only queſtion is, Whether theſe Bars were in the inſide of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or the outſide? It ſeems moſt probable they were without, under the Coverings; for they had not been ſo ſightly within.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And thou ſhalt overlay the boards with gold.</hi>] If they were overlaid with Plates of Gold, it made them very heavy; unleſs we ſuppoſe the Plates to have been very thin. Others therefore take it, that they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gilded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And make their rings of gold, for places for the bars,</hi> &amp;c.] The Staples were of maſſy Gold, into which the Bars went; which were alſo either overlaid with Plates of Gold, or gilded.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cunning work.</hi>] <hi>R. Solomon</hi> here repeats what he ſaid before on <hi>v.</hi> 1. that the Work called <hi>Choſcheb</hi> was ſo artificial, that it had not only figures on both ſides, but thoſe different one from the other: For example, on one ſide a Lion, on the other an Eagle. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith all ſorts of Flowers, and other Ornaments, were wrought in this Vail, except only the figures of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With Cherubims ſhalt thou make them.</hi>] See XXV. 18. This Vail ſeems to have been of the ſame Work with the reſt of the inward Hangings of the Tabernacle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>v.</hi> 1. unleſs we ſuppoſe that in them the <hi>Cherubims</hi> only were of <hi>Cunning Work.</hi> But I take the whole Work of this Vail to have been of that ſort; the <hi>Cherubims</hi> being in the midſt of all ſorts of Flowers and other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Paroketh,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Vail,</hi> coming from <hi>Perek,</hi> which ſignifies hardneſs and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, (I <hi>Exod.</hi> 13, 14.) it hath made ſome conclude, that this <hi>Vail</hi> was of a great thikneſs, (the Hebrews ſay <hi>four</hi> ſingers) which makes it the more wonderful that it was torn in ſunder at our Saviour's Paſſion. Certain it is, that it was ſo thick, that none could look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it into the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>And thou ſhalt hang it upon four pillars of Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim-wood, overlaid with gold.</hi>] This is a ſign that it was thick and heavy, there being four Pillars to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, which ſtood at an equal diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of <hi>Shittim-wood,</hi> ſee XXV. 5. It is uncertain whether the Pillars were plated over with Gold, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their hooks ſhall be of gold.</hi>] Some will have the word <hi>vavehim</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>heads</hi> of the Pillars; for ſo the LXX. calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But it litterally ſignifies <hi>hooks</hi>
                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:60246:261"/>(as we tranſlate it) in the form of the Letter <hi>Van,</hi> which were on the top of the Pillars, upon which the <hi>Vail</hi> was hung; as appears from the next Verſe.</p>

               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>And thou ſhalt hang up the Vail under the taches.</hi>] The golden Claſps that knit together the two great pieces of Hangings (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) were juſt between the <hi>Holy</hi> and the <hi>most holy place:</hi> So that the Vail, which ſeparated theſe two, hung exactly under theſe Claſps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thou mayeſt bring in thither, within the Vail, the Ark of the Teſtimony.</hi>] A ſeparate place being made by this Vail, the Ark was to be brought into it (See XXV. 16, 22.) and ſet at the Weſt-end of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Vail ſhall divide unto you, between the holy place and the moſt holy.</hi>] It made a Partition of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle into two parts; one of which was the <hi>holy Place,</hi> into which none but the Prieſts might enter; and the other <hi>the moſt holy,</hi> into which none but the high Prieſt might enter, and that but once in the Year. The moſt holy Place was but a <hi>third</hi> part of the Tabernacle; being a perfect Square, <hi>five</hi> yards high, and as many long and broad; according to the common Opinion concerning a <hi>Cubit.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet the Table without the Vail,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe only directs how the Table and the Candleſtick (which were ordered to be made XXV. 23, 31.) ſhould be ſet in <hi>the Holy Place,</hi> which was without the Vail; one of them on the South-ſide, and the other on the North-ſide over againſt it. But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the middle of the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> or more toward the upper end is not ſaid.</p>

               <p>Beſides this, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith there was another Vail of Linen, to defend it from the injury of the Weather; which was wont to be drawn aſide upon Feſtivals, that the People might ſee the Beauty of this firſt Vail. And indeed it is very probable, that ſome Curtain or other, was in bad weather, at leaſt, hung before it, to ſecure it; as the covering of Skins, was over the Hangings of the Tabernacle.</p>

               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>And thou ſhalt make for the hanging, five pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Shittim-wood.</hi>] Theſe Pillars ſeem to have been diſpoſed in this manner. Two of them were placed at each corner, which, if they took up a Cubit, then the other three being placed at an equal diſtance, made <hi>four</hi> ſpaces, each of two Cubits (<hi>i.e.</hi> a yard) wide: at which the Prieſts entred, when they went to Miniſter in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of Shittim-wood.</hi> What ſort of Wood this was ſee XXV. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Five Cubits long, and five Cubits broad,</hi> &amp;c.] It was two yards and an half ſquare (according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:60246:263"/>notion of a <hi>Cubit</hi>) at the top and bottom of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the height thereof ſhall be three Cubits.</hi>] Being a yard and half in height from the ground, the Prieſt (as <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> obſerves) who miniſtred at it, was half a yard above it; the common ſtature of a Man being four Cubits, <hi>i. e.</hi> two yards, <hi>Sacr. Elaeo. Myroth.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 65. It is not ſaid how thick the Wood was, of which this frame (as I may call it) was made; but it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it was hollow within, that the Grate menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>v.</hi> 4. might hang in the midſt of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>kerem,</hi> which properly ſignifies an <hi>horn,</hi> ſignifies alſo an eminent or High Place; as in V <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. God ſaith he had planted a Vineyard <hi>in a fruitful Hill;</hi> where the words in the Hebrew are <hi>in a horn of the Son of Oil.</hi> From whence it ſignifies a <hi>Pinacle,</hi> or <hi>Spire</hi> riſing up from any Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as theſe Horns did from the Altar, for the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Some will have it that they were uſeful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to tye the Sacrifices to it, (which they gather from CXVIII <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.) and that they were of the faſhion of Oxen or Rams-horns. <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> contends earneſtly for this (in his <hi>Myrothec.</hi> 2. <hi>Sacr. Elaeochriſm. c.</hi> 65.) ſuch Horns being much in uſe in the ancient Religion, as appears (he obſerves) from the Altars of the Gentiles. And yet he confeſſes in the LXIX Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Book, that ſuch kind of ſtraight Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as I mentioned before, after the manner of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks</hi> (as his words are) were more convenient for the putting of the Blood of the Sacrifices round about them, as is required XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His horns ſhall be of the ſame.</hi>] Theſe <hi>Spires</hi> ſeem to have been wrought out of the ſame piece of Wood, with the Corners of the Altar.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt overlay it with braſs.</hi>] Some think it was overlaid with Braſs, not only without, but within; that the fire which burnt in the <hi>Grate</hi> might not take hold of the Wood. To prevent which, others fancy it was lined within with unhewn Stone: but there is no mention of any ſuch thing; and it was unneceſſary, if the Braſs be ſuppoſed to have been of ſuch a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to ſecure the wooden frame of the Altar.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And thou ſhalt make his pans.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Siroth</hi> ſignifies Pots as well as Pans; but there is determined to the latter ſenſe, by the uſe of them, which here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To receive his aſhes.</hi>] Or rather to carry out the aſhes, which fell from the Altar upon the Earth; and being taken up, were put into theſe Pans, to be carried into a a clean place, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to delineate the form of them, in the Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, <hi>cap.</hi> 73.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his ſhovels.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Hajahim</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies <hi>Beeſoms</hi> or <hi>Brooms;</hi> but here is rightly tranſlated <hi>Shovels,</hi> by which, being made of Braſs, the Aſhes under the Altar were ſcraped together on an heap, and then thrown into the Pans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his baſons.</hi>] The principal uſe of theſe Veſſels was to receive the Blood of the Sacrifices, which was to be ſprinkled as the Law directed: For the Hebrew word <hi>Mizrakoth</hi> carries this ſignification in it. Beſides which <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> thinks they ſerved for the mixture of the Oyl, with ſine Flour and Frankincenſe, which were to be burnt on the Altar. For when any Man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Meat-offering, the Prieſt was to take an handful of the Flour and of the Oyl, with all the Frankincenſe, as Gods part, to be conſumed on the Altar; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſuppoſe ſome Veſſel wherein theſe were brought to the Prieſt, as the Law requires, II <hi>Lev.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <pb n="520" facs="tcp:60246:264"/>
               <p>

Scacchus</hi> thinks were in the form of a <hi>Trident.</hi> With which they ſtirred up the Fire; and alſo ordered the pieces of the Sacrifice, if any chanced to lye out of it, and put them into it, that every bit might be ſurely conſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his fire-pans.</hi>] Theſe are commonly taken for Diſhes or Cenſers, in which the Prieſt carried burning Coals from this Altar, into the Sanctuary, to offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe upon the Golden Altar. But the above-named <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> thinks they did not Miniſter in the Holy Place with brazen Cenſers; and therefore takes theſe <hi>Fire-pans</hi> for a larger ſort of Veſſel, wherein the Sacred Fire which came down from Heaven, was kept burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whilſt they cleanſed the Altar and the Grate from the Coals and Aſhes; and when this Altar was to be carried from one place to another, as it was often in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Myrothec.</hi> 2. <hi>Sacr. Elaeochriſm. c.</hi> 73.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And thou ſhalt make for a grate.</hi>] This was the principal part of the Altar; the Wood being laid here, and the Sacrifices burnt in it. Whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which was the Name the Heathen gave to the Fire-place upon their Altars, as we learn from <hi>Jul. Pollux.</hi> The figure of it was round (as <hi>Fort. Scac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> gathers from the very Name in Hebrew; for <hi>Mich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Scive</hi>) but grew leſs and leſs, till at the bottom it ended, like a Top, in a point. So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it in the fore-named Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 71.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Net-work.</hi>] It was made full of holes, like a <hi>Scive,</hi> or <hi>Net,</hi> (and thence called ſimply <hi>the Net,</hi> in the latter end of this Verſe, and in the next) that the Aſhes might fall through them to the bottom of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; where there was a Door, on the Eaſt-ſide, to open and take out the Aſhes.</p>
               <pb n="521" facs="tcp:60246:264"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of braſs.</hi>] The Motal of which all the fore-named things were made, and the Altar it ſelf was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And upon the Net.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grate full of holes, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt make four brazen rings.</hi>] The uſe of which was double; firſt that by them it might be hung upon the Altar: and then, when it was to be cleanſed, or removed in their Travels, it might by them be taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the four corners thereof.</hi>] This ſeems to overthrow what I now ſaid of its Circular Figure: But it is to be obſerved that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not uſe the ſame word here, which he doth when he ſpeaks of the four Corners of the Altar, which he calls <hi>Pinoth,</hi> v. 2. but calls theſe only <hi>Ketzoth,</hi> which may be better tranſlated the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities</hi> of it, as the ſaid <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> hath noted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And thou ſhalt put it under the compaſs of the Altar beneath.</hi>] Some have fancied that this Grate was placed only at the top of the Altar: but that doth not agree with theſe directions, which only place it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, in the hollow part of the Altar (called in the Hebrew <hi>Carcob,</hi> which ſignifies as <hi>R. Solomon</hi> ſaith, any thing that is round, and is by us tranſlated <hi>the Compaſs</hi>) but ſo much lower than the top of the Altar, that it was <hi>even to the midſt of it,</hi> as it here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Net may be even to the midst of the Altar.</hi>] This ſhows the depth of the Grate to have been a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and an half: for the Altar being three Cubits high (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) and the bottom of this being even to the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Altar,</hi> it muſt hang down half way to the ground, and conſequently be a Cubit and an half from the top of it to the bottom. So that this Grate ſeems to have been made like to a Furnace, full of holes round about, as well as below; and perhaps was hung by
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:60246:265"/>Chains, in the Rings before-mentioned, to the Horns of the Altar.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And thou ſhalt make ſtaves for the Altar,</hi> &amp;c.] Of ſuch a length that they might be laid upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Prieſts; and the Altar, when they carried it, hang between them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the ſtaves ſhall be put into the rings.</hi>] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Rings for the <hi>Grate,</hi> there were others (it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this) in the Altar it ſelf, into which the ſtaves were to be put, when it was to be removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the ſtaves ſhall be upon the two ſides of the Altar to bear it.</hi>] It's plain by this, that the Staves were not put into the Rings of the <hi>Grate</hi> (which was within the hollow part of the Altar) unleſs we imagine as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> doth, that the Rings of the <hi>Grate</hi> came through the frame of the Altar, and hung out on the ſides of it; ſo that the Frame and the Grate were carried toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But beſides other Objections againſt this, from the different form of the Grate and the Altar, it may be doubted whether they were carried together, and not ſeparate one from another; eſpecially if we conceive the Grate to have been carried with the Fire ſtill burning on it; which would have immediately conſumed the Purple Cloth, wherewith the Altar was to be covered, when they removed it, IV <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. But the <hi>Fine-pans</hi> before-mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 3. it is probable, as I noted there, received the Fire out of the <hi>Grate:</hi> and then, it being cleanſed from the Aſhes, was carried together with the Altar, to which it was faſtned by its Rings; a Purple Cloth being ſpread over both.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Hollow with boards ſhalt thou make it.</hi>] Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Grate could not have been in the midſt of it, as is before ordered, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the Court of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Chatzar</hi> properly ſignifies a <hi>green Field</hi> or <hi>Cloſe.</hi> Such was this place, uncovered, in the open Air; but incloſed with Pillars and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which made it ſuch a place as we call, a Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard before an Houſe. In this Court ſtood the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, or Dwelling-houſe of God: not juſt in the midſt of it, but towards the upper end. And here the Altar of Burnt-offering ſtood, between the Tabernacle and the lower end of the Court: and the Laver, wherein they waſhed, ſtood on one ſide of the Altar. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of more Courts than one, LXV <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. LXXXIV. 3. but <hi>Moſes</hi> made only one; into which the Prieſts came to offer Sacrifice. Whether the People were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into it, is not certain: if they were, it could contain no great number; and they ſtood at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Prieſts in the lower part of the Court; and were ſeparated by ſome bounds or other, as they were in after times when they came into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Where being ſetled, and the Tabernacle fixed in <hi>Shilo,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ſay it was incloſed with a Wall, as well as with Hangings: and then, it is likely, a diſtinct Court was made for the People; at leaſt, it was ſo in <hi>David</hi>'s time, as the places above-mentioned prove. And in the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> we read plainly of more Courts than one, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.36. VII. 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> IV. 9. XXXIII. 5. <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Court of the Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Court of the People.</hi> Unto which, in the Temple of <hi>Herod,</hi> after the Captivity, was added a third, the <hi>Court of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the ſouthſide, ſouthward.</hi>] It was to have two large ſides, as the Tabernacle had; whoſe South-ſide being firſt ordered to be made (XXVI. 18.) ſo is the ſame ſide of the Court.</p>
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:60246:266"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>There ſhall be hangings for the Court of fine twined Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</hi>] What <hi>fine Linen</hi> and <hi>twined</hi> were, ſee XXV. 5. XXVIII. 6. Theſe Hangings were not curiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Flowers, as thoſe of the Tabernacle were (XXVI. 1.) but were made of ſimple fine Six-threded Linen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of an hundred Cubits long, for one ſide.</hi>] By this it appears that the length of the Court was an hundred Cubits, or fifty Yards; though of Yards longer than ours, as I have ſaid before XXV. 10. See <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And the twenty Pillars thereof.</hi>] Theſe are thought by moſt to be made of <hi>Shittim-wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And their twenty ſockets ſhall be of braſs.</hi>] The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were placed, five Cubits diſtant from each other, upon Baſes of Braſs: which were more firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The hooks of the Pillars.</hi>] Theſe were like our <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> to hang the Curtains of the Court upon. See XXVI. 32. concerning the word <hi>Vave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And their fillets ſhall be of ſilver.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Chaſchuk</hi> properly ſignifies a <hi>Circle:</hi> but whether theſe were thin <hi>hoops</hi> of Silver, or only <hi>fillets,</hi> (as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it) or <hi>ſilver twist,</hi> is uncertain. Yet it ſeems to be plain from the XXXVIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, that the Heads of the Pillars, into which the Hooks were faſtned, were ſilvered over.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And likewiſe for the north-ſide,</hi> &amp;c.] Here are the very ſame directions given for the <hi>Hangings, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Baſes,</hi> &amp;c. of this ſide of the Court; which are nothing different from the former.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And for the breadth of the Court, on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſhall be hangings of fifty Cubits,</hi> &amp;c.] By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Court was as long again, as it was wide; there being Hangings but of half the length for the Weſt-end, and only half ſo many Pillars and Sockets.</p>
               <pb n="525" facs="tcp:60246:266"/>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>The breadth of the Court on the eaſt-ſide,</hi> &amp;c.] This end was of the ſame dimenſions with the Weſt-end.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>The hangings of one ſide of the gate, ſhall be fifteen Cubits,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hangings of this end of the Court were divided, becauſe there was to be a Gate; the entrance into the Court being at the Eaſt-end. Each ſide of the Gate conſiſted of fifteen Cubits; and accordingly the Hangings were of that length, upon three Pillars on each ſide; as this Verſe and the next directs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And for the gate of the Court ſhall be an hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of twenty Cubits.</hi>] The entrance being <hi>twenty</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits wide, if we add to them the <hi>fifteen</hi> Cubits which were on each ſide of the Entrance, they make in all <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Cubits; which was the breadth of this Eaſt-end of the Court, as well as of the Weſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of blue, and purple, and ſcarlet,</hi> &amp;c.] Concerning all this ſee XXV. 5. and here only obſerve, that the Hangings of the Gate were far richer, than of the reſt of the Court: which were meerly of fine twined <hi>Linen, v.</hi> 9. but theſe of ſeveral other beautiful Colours, and adorned, with that work which they called <hi>Rokem,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Needle-work.</hi> What that was ſee XXXVIII. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And their pillars ſhall be four, and their ſockets four.</hi>] Proportionable to thoſe on each ſide of the Gate; which were <hi>three</hi> for Hangings of <hi>fifteen</hi> Cubits, (<hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.) as theſe were <hi>four</hi> for Hangings of twenty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>All the Pillars round about the Court ſhall be filletted with ſilver.</hi>] Thoſe at the Eaſt and Weſt-end, as well as thoſe on the South and North-ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their hooks ſhall be of ſilver, and their ſockets of braſs.</hi>] As was before directed <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>The length of the Court,</hi> &amp;c.] Here all the Dimenſions of the Court are put together: the <hi>length</hi> and <hi>breadth</hi> of which might be inferred from the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:60246:267"/>(<hi>v.</hi> 9, 12, &amp;c.) but here are expreſly determined; together with the <hi>height,</hi> which was not at all intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; and now appointed to be <hi>five Cubits, l. e.</hi> two yards and an half, of larger meaſure than ours. So that the Tabernacle might be plainly ſeen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for it was as high again as the Walls (if I may ſo call them) that incompaſſed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of twined Linen, and their ſockets of braſs.</hi>] This ſeems to be a brief repetition of what was ſaid before concerning the Hangings, and the Pillars which ſtood on Baſes of Braſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>All the Veſſels of the Tabernacle in all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof.</hi>] This is alſo a repetition in general of what was ſaid before particularly (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) for all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels belonging to the Tabernacle it ſelf, were of Gold, as we read in the XXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the pins thereof.</hi>] The Tabernacle had nothing of Braſs in the Fabrick of it, but the Baſes of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars at the Entrance, XXVI. 37. and therefore theſe <hi>Pins,</hi> I ſuppoſe, belong to them, whereby the Pillars were faſtned in their Sockets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the pins of the Court ſhall be of braſs.</hi>] Theſe brazen Pins were ſtruck into the ground (as Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> underſtands it) that the Hangings, which were tied to them by Cords, might be kept from flying up at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And thou ſhalt command the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>that they bring thee pure Oyl-olive beaten.</hi>] Not ſqueezed out by a Preſs, or by a Mill, (for ſuch was full of Sediment and Dregs) but which run freely from the Olives, being bruiſed with a Peſtel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To cauſe the Lamp to burn always.</hi>] Sufficient to keep the Lamp always burning. Some imagine, that it did not burn day and night, but being lighted every Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:60246:267"/>went out in the Morning. And there are ſome places which ſeem to favour this Opinion, particularly 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> III. 3. where mention is made of the Lamp go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Morning. See alſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XIII. 11. where we read of <hi>ſetting the Lamps to burn every Evening:</hi> which ſeems to ſigniſie that they did not burn in the Day. But <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was a Prieſt, and could not but know, and had no reaſon to tell a lie, ſaith they burnt Day and Night. And indeed it was but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for otherwiſe the Prieſts muſt have miniſtred in the dark, at the Altar of Incenſe, before the Divine Majeſty. Who kept a Table in the Sanctuary, which required light; for no Body feaſts in darkneſs. And therefore <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> (<hi>Praecept.</hi> XCVIII.) ſaith, God commanded a Lamp ſhould always burn in the Sanctuary, for the Honour and Majeſty of it; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Light conveyed to it otherways. But it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, there were not ſo many of the Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Day, as in the Night, when all the ſeven Lamps were lighted: ſome of which were put out in the Morning, and lighted again in the Evening. So <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 9. <hi>Three burnt all Day before the LORD, and the rest were lighted in the Evening.</hi>

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>AND take thou</hi> Aaron <hi>thy brother, and his ſons with him, from among the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] Here <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons are deſigned to the Prieſts Office: and afterward (XXXII. 19.) the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were Conſecrated to the LORD by a noble Act of Zeal which they performed. And at laſt (I <hi>Numb.</hi> 51. and many other places) it was made Capital for any one elſe to officiate at the Tabernacle, but they only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he may miniſter unto me.</hi>] Attend on me as my Servant in my Court. For <hi>Cohen</hi> ſignifies one that ſerves <hi>in miniſterio honorabili,</hi> in an honourable Office, as appears from XII <hi>Job</hi> 19. Therefore <hi>David</hi>'s Sons are called by this Name, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 18. and it was given to the Prieſts, <hi>quatenus fuerunt primarij Dei Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri,</hi> as they were the principal Miniſters of God; as <hi>Junius</hi> obſerves upon XLI <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Priests Office.</hi>] Whereſoever there hath been any Religion, there have been Prieſts; whoſe Office it peculiarly was, to Miniſter unto God in the Service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him. But this is the firſt time we read of any Conſtituted in <hi>Iſrael</hi> by a Divine appointment; at leaſt, the Prieſthood was not confined to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was made High Prieſt, and his Sons Prieſts of a lower Order. Some Heathens imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated this, by continuing the Prieſthood in a certain Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. For <hi>Plato</hi> ſays there were in ſome places <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both of Men and Women; which in the founding of a City he would not have a Law-giver al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but where there was no ſuch Conſtitution, he would have annual Prieſts, and none but grave Men of 60 years of Age put into the Office, <hi>L.</hi> VI. <hi>de Leg. p.</hi> 759.</p>
               <pb n="529" facs="tcp:60246:268"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even</hi> Aaron, Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu, Eleazar <hi>and</hi> Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Aarons <hi>ſons.</hi>] Theſe were all the Males in this Family at preſent; whoſe Deſcendants in future Ages were all Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt make holy Garments for</hi> Aarou <hi>thy brother.</hi>] If very good Authors did not affirm it, we ſhould ſcarce think it credible, that the Prieſts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome of the ancient Heathens, offered Sacrifices to their Gods naked. Particularly the old <hi>Arabians,</hi> as <hi>Hottinger</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Histor. Orientalis, L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 7. But ſuch filthineſs was abhorred by moſt People, whoſe Prieſts were not only Clothed, but performed their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the Altar, in a peculiar Habit. So that there is ſcarce any Author, who treats of the Sacrifices and the Prieſts of the Heathens, that doth not ſpeak of their Garments alſo. As <hi>Moſes</hi> here in the firſt Inſtitution of the Prieſthood among the Jews, to offer peculiar Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at God's Houſe, takes a ſpecial care, by the Divine direction, about their Veſtments. Which the Hebrew Doctors think ſo inſeparable from the Prieſthood, that they fancy <hi>Adam, Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> did not Sacrifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. See III <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>They are called <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe they might be worn by none but them; and by them, only when they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Aaron <hi>thy brother.</hi>] The High Prieſt had ſome Garments peculiar to himſelf, which none of the other Prieſts might wear. They were <hi>four;</hi> the <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> the <hi>Robe,</hi> the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and the <hi>Plate of Gold.</hi> There were <hi>four</hi> more he alſo wore, but they were common to him with the other Prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Coat,</hi> the <hi>Drawers,</hi> the <hi>Girdle,</hi> and the <hi>Bonnet.</hi> Their <hi>Bonnets</hi> indeed and his <hi>Miter</hi> were of a different form; yet they are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by the Jews, as diſtinct Veſtments, being both Coverings of the Head. And they make account the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:60246:269"/>High Prieſt never wore at one time above <hi>eight</hi> ſorts of Garments; nor the lower above <hi>four.</hi> This is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal ſenſe of the Hebrew Writers; and I cannot give any account, why <hi>Grotius</hi> mentions only <hi>ſeven</hi> Garments of the High Prieſt (reckoning the <hi>golden Plate</hi> for one) which he will have to anſwer unto the ſeven Lamps in the Candleſtick. For it is evident by this very Chapter he wore eight, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ephod,</hi> v. 8. the <hi>Brest-plate,</hi> v. 15. the <hi>Robe,</hi> v. 31. the <hi>Plate of Gold,</hi> v. 36. the <hi>embroidered Coat,</hi> the <hi>Girdle</hi> and the <hi>Mitre,</hi> v. 39. which are all ordered for <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt: and afterward (<hi>v.</hi> 42, 43.) <hi>Breeches</hi> are ordered for him as well as his Sons; which make up the number of <hi>eight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For glory and for beauty.</hi>] To make their Office more reſpected, and ſtrike Men with an awful ſenſe of the Divine-Majeſty, whoſe Miniſters they ſaw appear in ſuch grandeur. For this, and the foregoing Precepts (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves) were given to render the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of God more auguſt and magnificent; for which end he magnified the Dignity of thoſe who Miniſtred there; and not only ſeparated them from other Men, but ordered them to be clothed in beautiful and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Garments, that they might appear there like Men of Honour, <hi>More Nevoch. L.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 45. unto which <hi>R. Levi</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> well adds, (<hi>Praecept.</hi> XCIX.) that by theſe glorious Garments the Prieſts were put in mind of their Dignity, and admoniſhed to perform the Divine Service, with a Spirit ſuitable to the greatneſs of him, unto whom they were Conſecrated. It may be ſit for me alſo to add, That there being two ſorts of Garments, which the High Prieſt wore (thoſe they called <hi>white,</hi> and theſe they called <hi>golden</hi>) both of them were very rich, and made him look gloriouſly; whether the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, or the Colours, or the Art wherewith they were
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:60246:269"/>made, be regarded; as will appear in the particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which is given of them in this Chapter. See <hi>v.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſpeak unto all that are wiſe-hearted.</hi>] So the Hebrews call thoſe, who had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary skill in any Art: according to the ancient Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which made the <hi>Heart</hi> the Seat of the Mind.</p>

The principal of theſe excellent Artiſts were <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> XXXI. 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That he may miniſter to me in the Prieſts office.</hi>] For without theſe Garments he might not miniſter. Whence that common ſaying in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> concerning the Prieſts, <hi>While they are clothed in their Garments they are Prieſts; when they want them, they are not Prieſts.</hi> Which <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſſes thus; When they are clothed in their Garments, their Prieſthood is upon them; when they are not clothed with them, their Prieſthood is not upon them. That is, they might no more perform Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, than meer Lay-men. Whence it was that under the ſecond Temple, (when they wanted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oyl to anoint him) the High Prieſt was made, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by clothing him, with the fore-named <hi>eight</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And as they might not miniſter without theſe, ſo they might not add any other to them: If they did, their miniſtry was unlawful. For which reaſon they might not wear <hi>Gloves</hi> on their Hands, or <hi>Shoes</hi> on their feet: for from their Knees (to which their Breeches reached) to their feet, they were naked; only their Coats, in ſome ſort, covered their Legs. But they ſtood barefoot in the Sanctuary while they miniſtred. We do not find indeed that God any where forbid them to miniſter in Shoes; but they being not commanded, when God orders other Veſtments, particularly <hi>Bonnets</hi> for their Heads, and ſaith here expreſly, theſe are the Garments thou ſhalt make, that <hi>Aaron may miniſter to
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:60246:270"/>me in the Prieſts Office;</hi> the Jews thence concluded, that God intended they ſhould uſe no other, and not ſo much as any thing on their Feet in the Sanctuary. And this out of Reverence to that holy Place; as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was commanded to put off his Shoes, becauſe of the Preſence of God in that Ground where he ſtood.</p>
               <p>Which to me is an Argument that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come as near to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Rites, as he might with ſafety, but rather to oppoſe them. For their Prieſts had <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo the Prieſts of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Nations miniſtred in Shoes of ſeveral kinds: though others, it is certain, miniſtred barefoot; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Prieſts of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Caſtobala,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> XII. And nothing is more known than that ſaying of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60246:271"/>of their Miniſtration: at other times they never wore them, but were then habited like other Men; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> proves <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Succeſſion. c.</hi> 7. and at large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>de Synedr. c.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 3. &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Shall take gold,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe directs to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, of which the Prieſt's Garments were to be made. For though theſe five words denote ſo many colours; yet the firſt word and the laſt (<hi>viz. Gold</hi> and <hi>ſine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen</hi>) ſhow the Matter alſo is included; from which Colour cannot be ſeparated. And as for the Matter of their Garments, they were made either of Woollen or Linen; nothing of Hair, or Silk being uſed in their Contexture: For as to <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Jewels,</hi> they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Ornament, than for the making the Subſtance of the Garments. So all the Hebrew Doctors, whoſe Maxim is this, <hi>The Prieſts are not clothed in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry at the Temple, but in Wollen and Linnen.</hi> The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them indeed is not here expreſſed in this Chapter, ſave only of their <hi>Breeches,</hi> which are ordered to be made of Linen, <hi>v.</hi> 42. But in XXXIX. 27, &amp;c. all the Garments of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons are expreſly ſaid to be made of fine Linen; except the Girdle, which was partly of Linen, partly of Woollen. The Garments of the High Prieſt, which the Jews call <hi>white Garments,</hi> were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made of Linen; and his Girdle alſo was of the ſame, without any mixture of Woollen, when he wore thoſe Garments, on the great Day of Expiation, as <hi>Braunius</hi> ſhows <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Veſtitu Sac. Hebr. c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold.</hi>] The Hebrews ſay there was ſeven ſorts of Gold, which was diverſified either by its colour, or the place from which it came, or its goodneſs. But that which was uſed about theſe Garments, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude was the Gold they called <hi>tahor,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:60246:271"/>
                  <hi>pure Gold,</hi> v. 22, 37. <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſineſt, and of the brighteſt colour; between a yellow and red.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And fine Linen.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Scheſch</hi> ſignifies a pure kind of ſine Linen, not Silk (as ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) for there was no ſuch thing known in <hi>Moſes</hi> his days. It was of a ſhining white Colour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Inferiour Prieſts were clothed in white, their Garments being made of this. And ſuch were all the Garments wherewith the High Prieſt entred into the moſt holy Place, on the great Day of Expiation. And whereſoever the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>ſine Linen,</hi> and mentions no Colour, we are to underſtand white.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And they ſhall make the Ephod.</hi>] We retain the Hebrew word, which doth not expreſs the form of this Garment; but the next Verſe teaches us ſomething of it; that it was a ſhort Garment which hung behind upon the Shoulders down to the Buttocks, and came down before upon the Breaſt and the Belly. It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of three parts; that which covered the Breaſt and the Back (which the Hebrews take to be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Ephod</hi>) than the two Shoulder pieces, which came up from the Arm-holes to the Shoulders (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the next Verſe) and then the Girdle belonging to it, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And fine twined Linen.</hi>] Here is another word ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Scheſch</hi> (or <hi>ſine Linen</hi>) which is <hi>Maſchzar.</hi> Which is never joyned with any thing but <hi>Scheſch</hi> in all the Scripture; and only once found without <hi>Scheſch,</hi> which is to be underſtood XXXIX. 24. It is thought by <hi>Maimonides</hi> and other Hebrew Doctors, to ſignifie <hi>Linen of ſix threds:</hi> Some will have it, that where it
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:60246:272"/>is mentioned alone, it ſignifies <hi>eight thredded Linen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With cunning work.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>cunning,</hi> ſignifies the moſt artificial, or ingenious ſort of Work; which conſiſted in the great variety of Figures and Colours that were in it; like that which is ſometimes made of divers Birds feathers; as <hi>J. Braunius</hi> ſhows <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Vest. Sacr. Hebr. c.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>It ſhall have the two ſhoulder-pieces thereof.</hi>] They are ſo called, becauſe they covered the Shoulders: from whence the LXX. call the whole <hi>Ephod,</hi> by the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Jews think they were woven by themſelves, and then ſewed to the back and breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces with a Needle. So the next words ſeem to them to ſignifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joyned at the two edges thereof.</hi>] Which <hi>Abarbinel</hi> interprets in this manner; The <hi>Ephod</hi> ſhall have two Shoulder-pieces, which being made by themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from it, were afterwards ſewed to the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the <hi>Ephod.</hi> But the Hebrew words, if they be examined, import no ſuch thing; but run thus, <hi>It ſhall have two ſhoulder-pieces, joyned at the two ends of it.</hi> Now they might be joyned in the very weaving of it, and not by a Needle afterward: and ſo they were in all probability, as <hi>Braunius</hi> hath endeavoured to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo it ſhall be joyned together.</hi>] In the Hebrew the words are no more but theſe, <hi>and it ſhall be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> which may be underſtood of the coherence of the fore-part and hinder-part, by the two golden Buttons ſet with <hi>Onyx</hi> ſtones, which joyned them together on the Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And the curious girdle of the Ephod.</hi>] The word <hi>Choſheb,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>curious</hi> Girdles, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies it was of ſuch artificial Work as the <hi>Ephod</hi> it ſelf was. And it ſeems to have been two ſtrings (as we
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:60246:272"/>may call them) which went out of each ſide of it, and tied it to their Bodies, under their Arm-holes about the heart. So the High Prieſt had two Girdles; that Belt (as we may call it) which tied his Coat to him; and this Girdle which tied the fore-part and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the <hi>Ephod</hi> together. It is called the <hi>Girdle of the Ephod,</hi> becauſe it was annexed to thoſe two Clothes, and not to the Shoulder-pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall be of the ſame.</hi>] Or, <hi>Out of it:</hi> to ſignifie that the Girdle was woven together with the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and went out of it. So <hi>Jarchi</hi> and <hi>Abarbinel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the work thereof.</hi>] This ſignifies it was to be made of the ſame Matter, and woven after the ſame manner, with all the Ornaments of the <hi>Ephod</hi> it ſelf; having all thoſe <hi>five</hi> Colours in it, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 4. and here repeated again.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt take two Onyx-ſtones.</hi>] Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Onyx-ſtone</hi> ſee II <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And grave on them the names of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] The Princes (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves) preſented <hi>Moſes</hi> with theſe Stones; on which he himſelf did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſome perſon skilful in that Art. For it is expreſly called, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>The work of an Engraver in Stone.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Six of their names on one ſtone, and the other ſix names of the rest on the other ſtone, according to their birth.</hi>] The ſix eldeſt on that Stone which was upon the right Shoulder; and the ſix younger on the other upon the left: as ſeveral of the Hebrew Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it; particularly <hi>Jarchi,</hi> with whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 8. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> indeed diſpoſe them otherwiſe; but this is moſt ſutable to the word <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth</hi> according to their <hi>Generations,</hi> or their <hi>Birth,</hi> as we render the latter end of the Verſe.</p>

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>With the work of an engraver in ſtone.</hi>] Done with ſuch Art as ſuch Workmen uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like the engravings of a ſignet.</hi>] The ſame words are uſed again <hi>v.</hi> 36. where he ſpeaks of the Engravings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Plate of Gold.</hi> On which <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſaith the Letters were protuberant, as they are upon Coins, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wax impreſſed with a Seal: but here on the <hi>Ephod</hi> and the Breaſt-plate, he thinks the names were cut deep in the Stones, as Letters are in a Seal. For which I can ſee no reaſon, the words being the very ſame: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Letters were protuberant in the one, they were ſo in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt make them to be ſet in ouches of gold.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Miſchbetzoth,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>ouches,</hi> ſignifies as much as the Latin word <hi>funda;</hi> the <hi>ſocket,</hi> as I may ſay, wherein the Stones were ſet. Both which made a <hi>Button;</hi> not of a round figure, but ſomething like a <hi>Lozenge,</hi> or as <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſſes it, like the figure of thoſe holes, that are in the Stomach of ſuch Animals as chew the Cud, called <hi>reticulum.</hi> See <hi>Joh. Braunius de Veſt. Saer. Heby. L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 8. By theſe Buttons the hinder-part of the <hi>Ephod</hi> was faſtned to the fore-part upon the Shoulders; and the <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> alſo hung upon them, by golden Chains.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And thou ſhalt put the two ſtones upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Ephod, for ſtones of memorial unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael.] This is explained in the following words, that <hi>Aaron might bear their Names before the LORD, upon his ſhoulders for a memorial.</hi> That is, might remember to recommend the XII. Tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> unto God, when he offered Incenſe, and made his Prayers before him. Or, for a Token that he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, in the Name of the whole People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:60246:273"/>
               <p>Others will have this <hi>Memorial</hi> refer to God, before whom he preſented himſelf, that he might be gracious unto his People, when the High Prieſt came thus atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, according to his own order to pray for them; with aſſurance that he would be mindful of them all. And to this the 29th Verſe ſeems to incline; where the ſame is ſaid to be the intention of engraving their Names upon the XII. Stones on the Breaſt-plate. See XXXIX. 7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And thou ſhalt make ouches of gold.</hi>] See <hi>v.</hi> 11. where the word <hi>Miſohbetzoth</hi> is explained.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And two chains of pure gold at the ends,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe <hi>Chains</hi> did not conſiſt of many little <hi>rings,</hi> but of many <hi>threds</hi> or <hi>wires</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> twiſted together like a Rope. For which reaſon <hi>Moſes</hi> adds, <hi>of wreathen work ſhalt thou make them.</hi> This <hi>Bartenora</hi> takes to be the meaning of the word <hi>migbaloth</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>at the ends</hi>) which he expounds <hi>Cords</hi> or <hi>Cables.</hi> They were not, ſaith he, like to thoſe Iron Chains wherewith Priſoners are bound, conſiſting of ſeveral Joynts; but twiſted of Golden threds, till they were as thick as Cords. Others think <hi>migbaloth</hi> ſignifies <hi>equal;</hi> becauſe they were of an equal thickneſs, or of an equal length. But our Tranſlation alſo may be defended; for the ends of them were annexed to the Rings of the Breaſt-plate, <hi>v.</hi> 24. But as theſe Chains were annexed at one end to the Rings of the Breaſt-plate, ſo at the other end they were annexed to the Golden Buttons upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſo that the Breaſt-plate hung upon the Golden Buttons by the Chains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And faſten the wreathen chains to the ouches.</hi>] <hi>Moſes</hi> only briefly mentions the two Chains in this place, to ſignifie that the <hi>Ouches</hi> in the <hi>Ephod</hi> ſerved for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> by theſe two Chains; which properly belonged to that, and not to the <hi>Ephod,</hi> as <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:60246:274"/>obſerves. And therefore after directions for the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> (which here follow) they are again ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in their proper place, <hi>v.</hi> 22. As <hi>v.</hi> 27. there are two golden Rings ſpoken of, which belong to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod;</hi> but not mentioned till then, becauſe by theſe Rings the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> and <hi>Ephod</hi> were knit together.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the Breast-plate</hi>] Next after the <hi>Ephod</hi> directions is given for the <hi>Choſchen,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Breaſt-plate;</hi> taking it, I ſuppoſe, to come from the Hebrew word <hi>Chazeh,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Breast.</hi> For by the change of a Letter (which is not unuſual) <hi>Choſchen</hi> may well be thought to come from thence, becauſe it lay upon the Breaſt, and covered it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Judgment.</hi>] For the Prieſt wore it, when he went to conſult the Divine Majeſty, about the great Concerns of their Religion or Government; and received ſuch Anſwers, as directed them what to determine in dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Caſes, either in War or Peace.

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Four-ſquare ſhall it be being doubled.</hi>] The words are in the Hebrew, <hi>four-ſquare ſhall it be doubled.</hi> Which are to be thus underſtood, that the whole Piece was not ſquare, till it was doubled. So <hi>Maimonides.</hi> It was a Cubit long (<hi>i. e.</hi> two Spans) and its breadth a Span: but being doubled, it was a ſquare of a Span, both in length and in breadth. From whence it follows that it was hollow; ſo that it may be compared to one of our Purſes: only, it doth not appear, whether it were ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together at the ſides, or on one ſide, or open on both ſides; though it is commonly ſaid ſo to be. But it is poſſible that it was doubled, meerly that it might be ſtronger to bear the weight of ſo many precious
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:60246:274"/>Stones, and of the Rings and Chains; not that it might have any thing put between it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſet in it ſettings of ſtones.</hi>] Or, as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>fill it with fillings of ſtones.</hi> Which plainly ſignifies that theſe Stones were ſet, as precious Stones are now in our Rings, in a <hi>funda</hi> or <hi>hollow,</hi> which was filled up with the Stone. In the 20th Verſe we tranſlate it <hi>incloſings.</hi> So <hi>Jarchi,</hi> becauſe the Stone fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the hollowneſs of the <hi>Ouches</hi> to which they were fitted, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes the word <hi>ſillings.

               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt row ſhall be a Sardius,</hi> &amp;c.] There is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle certainty what theſe Stones were, that nothing can be affirmed about them; as appears by the vaſt variety of Interpretations, that have been made of them, by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both old and new. The firſt of them is called <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> in the Hebrew, which ſome take to be a <hi>Ruby;</hi> but have no other reaſon for it, but only becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

Others take it for an <hi>Adamant;</hi> which may ſeem to be derived from <hi>Odem,</hi> as a <hi>Jaſpri</hi> is from <hi>Jaſphe.</hi> And there are ſeveral other Conjectures, but none ſo probable as that of our Tranſlators; who call it a <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> (or <hi>Sardine</hi> Stone, as they render it IV <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.)
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:60246:275"/>which is of a red flaming Colour (as <hi>Braunius</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated from ſeveral Authors, <hi>L.</hi> H. <hi>de Vest. Sacr.

And it is not improbable that this Stone had the Name of <hi>Sardius</hi> from the Hebrew word <hi>Sered,</hi> which ſignifies red, XLIV <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. as <hi>Kimchi</hi> there interprets it. And thence the Divine Majeſty is ſaid to look like a <hi>Sardine</hi> Stone (in the place above-named) becauſe he appeared in great anger. So an ancient Writer, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>A Topaz.</hi>] The ſecond Stone in this row, is in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew called <hi>Pitdah,</hi> which we truly tranſlate a <hi>Topaz:</hi> which was a Stone of a green Colour, not a yellow, as we now commonly underſtand it. So <hi>Pliny</hi> and others, as the ſame <hi>Braunius</hi> ſhows <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 9. where he fancies that the word <hi>Topaſion,</hi> by an eaſie change of Letters was made out of <hi>Pitdah:</hi> for the Syriack Interpreter XXI <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. calls this Stone <hi>Topadion;</hi> in which there are the ſame Letters that are in <hi>Pitdah.</hi> But however this be, it appears from the XXVIII <hi>Job</hi> 19. that this is the right Tranſlation of the word; for there it is <hi>Pitdah Cuſh,</hi> the moſt excellent <hi>Topaz</hi> Stones, being found in an Iſland belonging to <hi>Arabia,</hi> called thence by the Name of <hi>Topazion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a Carbuncle.</hi>] So we tranſlate the third Stone of the firſt row (which in Hebrew is called <hi>Bareketh</hi>) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing perhaps <hi>Aberbinel.</hi> But the greateſt part of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters take it for the <hi>Smaragdus:</hi> which good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors deſcribe as the moſt radiant of all other Stones; and therefore called perhaps <hi>Bareketh,</hi> from its extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſplendour. For <hi>barak,</hi> every Body knows, fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to <hi>glitter,</hi> XXI <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10. The beſt Authors ſay, the Colour of it is a <hi>Graſs-green;</hi> wonderfully refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as <hi>Pliny</hi> deſcribes it) to the eyes, when one looks upon it.</p>
               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:60246:275"/>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And the ſecond row ſhall be an Emeraud.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Nophech,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud,</hi> is by moſt Interpreters taken to ſignifie a <hi>Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> Some of which Stones are white; but the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all other are red, ſhining like Fire, or a burning Coal: whence the Name of <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> from <hi>Carbo</hi> a hot Coal. And to this the Hebrew word <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phech</hi> agrees; which <hi>Braunius</hi> ingeniouſly conjectures comes from <hi>Phuch,</hi> which ſignifies that Red wherewith Women painted their Faces, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> IX. 30. And, in ſhort, he takes it for that Stone which now we call a <hi>Ruby.</hi> And ſo <hi>Abarbinel</hi> tranſlates it, and <hi>Luther</hi> alſo; <hi>vid. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Saphire.</hi>] This Stone is mentioned before, XXIV. 9. and it retains its Name to this day, almoſt among all People. So that there is no queſtion, but only what kind of Stone it was, about which Authors differ. For ſome ſay it was a white Stone, (and there are ſome ſo pale, that they incline to that rather than any other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) but it is plain, that Stone was called anciently a <hi>Saphire,</hi> which is now ſo called; being of the Colour of the Heavens, or the Veins, that is, a <hi>Sky-colour.</hi> See XXIV. 10. V <hi>Cantic.</hi> 14. IV <hi>Lament.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a Diamond.</hi>] So we rightly tranſlate the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Jahalom;</hi> which is thought to come from <hi>halam,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>break.</hi> Whence <hi>Halmuth</hi> is an <hi>Hammer,</hi> or a <hi>Mad,</hi> V <hi>Judg.</hi> 26. For the Adamant or Diamond is the hardeſt of all Stones; which breaks them all, but is broken by none, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſpeaks. It was anciently accounted the moſt precious of all Gems, as <hi>Pliny</hi> acknowledges <hi>L.</hi> XXXVII. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>In the third row, a Ligure.</hi>] So we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Hebrew word <hi>Leſchem,</hi> which being no where elſe found, the meaning of it is uncertain. But a great many, both of the Ancient and Modern, tranſlate it as
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:60246:276"/>we do: though what a <hi>Ligure</hi> is, cannot eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Some think <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be nothing but the beſt <hi>Ambar.</hi> But that is no precious Stone, as all here mentioned are; and therefore (to mention no other Conjectures) <hi>Braunius</hi> thinks we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by this word, a kind of <hi>Jacinth:</hi> of which there being divers ſorts, he judges it likely to be that which neareſt approaches to the colour of <hi>Ambar;</hi> which hath made Authors take them for the ſame. The Ancients indeed commonly by a <hi>Jacinth</hi> underſtand a Stone of a Violet colour, but more pale and dilute than in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methyſt:</hi> and the Stone now called an <hi>Amethyſt,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called a <hi>Jacinth.</hi> Yet they mention <hi>Jacinths</hi> of divers other colours, and ſome ſhining like Fire; <hi>vide L.</hi> II. <hi>de Veſtit. Sacr. Hebr. c.</hi> 14. <hi>n.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Agate.</hi>] So the Hebrew word <hi>Schebo</hi> (which is no where elſe mentioned in Scripture) is tranſlated by the greateſt part of Interpreters; who take this for that Stone the Greeks call <hi>Achates.</hi> Which is ſo well known that it needs no deſcription; being that beautiful Stone which Nature hath painted with great variety: from whence it hath got ſeveral Names, as the ſame <hi>Braunius</hi> obſerves in the ſame Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 4. &amp;c. And the very Name of <hi>Achates,</hi> ſeems to be derived from its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colours: <hi>Akud</hi> in Hebrew ſignifying that which is ſpotted, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Cattle were, XXX <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. Though now, becauſe they are common, they are of no great value; yet anciently, it appears from <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> they were more precious. See there <hi>n.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And an Amethyst.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Achlama</hi> is no more to be found in Scripture elſewhere, than the two former. But the beſt and moſt ancient Authors take it as we do, for that Stone which other Writers call an <hi>Amethyst.</hi> Which is of a bright Violet colour, or
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:60246:276"/>like red Wine, from whence it hath its Name in the Greek. The nearer theſe Stones came to a Purple, and the more they had of the Flame of a <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> the more precious they were eſteemed, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Braunius</hi> ſhows <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 56.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>In the fourth row, a Beryl.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Tharſchiſch</hi> is very variouſly interpreted; but the LXX. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and a great many others, take it for that which the Ancients call a <hi>Chryſolite;</hi> that is, a Stone of a golden Colour, which others call a <hi>Topaz.</hi> This <hi>Braunius</hi> indeavours to prove was the colour of <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiſch</hi> out of X <hi>Dan.</hi> 5, 6. V <hi>Cant.</hi> 14. &amp;c. See <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 12, 13, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Onyx.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Schoham</hi> we meet withal in the beginning of the Bible (II <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.) and tranſlate it as we do here, <hi>an Onyx.</hi> But <hi>Joſephus,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> tranſlate it <hi>Sardonyx;</hi> which was of a mixt Colour, of white and red. For the moſt precious Indian <hi>Sardonyx,</hi> had a Radix (as they call it) white, like the Nail of ones Finger; and the Superficies red like Blood; and both of them tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: From whence it had its Name; the <hi>Sardius</hi> Stone (as was ſaid before) being red, and the <hi>Onyx</hi> ſignifying the Nail of ones Finger. See the fore-named <hi>Brauni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us c.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Jaſper.</hi>] Though the Hebrew Name, which is <hi>Jaſpeh,</hi> be retained among all People to this day, yet all Interpreters have not tranſlated it as ours do, who, no doubt, are in the right. For why ſhould we not think <hi>Jaſpeh</hi> is certainly that Stone which the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins call <hi>Jaſpri:</hi> as we doubt not the <hi>Saphire</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) is the Stone they call <hi>Saphirus.</hi> The beſt of theſe Stones are of a green Colour, like a <hi>Smaragdus;</hi> but ſometimes they have little ſpots or points in them, of various colours: which hath made ſome
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:60246:277"/>Authors call this Stone <hi>Panthera.</hi> See <hi>Braunius c.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And the ſtones ſhall be with the names of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Upon each Stone was to be engraven the Name of one of the Sons of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And, in all probability, in the ſame order wherein they were engraven upon the two Stones of the <hi>Ephod:</hi> where it is ordered they ſhould be engraven <hi>according to their birth,</hi> v. 10.

               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And thou ſhalt make upon the Breaſt-plate, Chains.</hi>] Theſe <hi>Chains</hi> are not different from thoſe mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 14. as ſome imagine: who think there he ſpeaks of the Chains of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and here of thoſe of the <hi>Breaſt-plate.</hi> For the <hi>Ephod</hi> had no <hi>Chains</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, nor needed any: and the <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> had only theſe two; which, though mentioned before, are now more exactly deſcribed in their proper place, and the uſe of them directed.</p>

                  <hi>At the ends.</hi>] Concerning the word <hi>gabluth,</hi> ſee <hi>v.</hi> 14. where I obſerved, ſome think it ſignifies <hi>Cords,</hi> from <hi>gabal,</hi> which, as well as <hi>chabal,</hi> ſignifies a Rope or Cord; from whence ſome fancy comes our Engliſh word <hi>Cable.</hi>

But if the former of theſe were true, I ſhould think it would have been as plainly mentioned, that God delivered theſe unknown things to him, as that he did the two Tables of Stone.

<pb n="550" facs="tcp:60246:279"/>the making of all thoſe things which are here ordered; he mentions only the four rows of Stones, in the ſame manner as he doth here; but ſaith not a word of putting the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> in the <hi>Breast-plate:</hi> though he ſpake particularly of other things, even of the <hi>Rings,</hi> and the <hi>Chains,</hi> and the <hi>Lace</hi> whereby it was tied to the <hi>Ephod.</hi> And on the other ſide, when he ſpeaks of habiting <hi>Aaron</hi> with all theſe Veſtments, in order to his Conſecration, he only ſaith VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. that <hi>he put the Breast-plate upon him, alſo he put in the Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and the Thummim;</hi> but ſaith not a word of the four rows of Stones. For which it is hard to give a reaſon; unleſs it be, becauſe the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi> were one and the ſame thing with the XII. precious Stones: So that it was indifferent, whether he ſaid <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were put into the <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> or the XII. precious Stones; which are the only things in all this deſcription of the holy Veſtments, that can be thought to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> And indeed, there being ſuch a particular direction for every thing elſe, and alſo a deſcription of their form and faſhion, (as that the <hi>Chains</hi> ſhould be of <hi>wreathen work</hi>) one cannot but think there would have been ſomething ſaid of theſe, if they had been diſtinct from what was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> indeed thinks that nothing is ſaid concerning them, becauſe they were things well known to the Patriarchs. But this is well confuted lately, by another great Man, Dr. <hi>Pocock,</hi> in his late learned Commentary upon the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, pag.</hi> 149. unto which I refer the Reader, becauſe I have other things to note, and would not willingly enlarge too much on this Subject.</p>
               <p>As for that which ſome have ſaid concerning two little Images, or Repreſentations of Angels, which were put in the hollow of the Breaſt-plate, I ſee no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:60246:279"/>for ſuch a Conceit. One may better ſay, that theſe two words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> were written, or wrought on the Breaſt-plate; ſignifying that from hence they ſhould receive the cleareſt and moſt perfect Reſolution of all their Doubts. And of this opinion was <hi>R. Aſaria</hi> in his <hi>Meor Enajim, c.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>But if we take the former to be the truer Account, that he only repeats what he ſaid before (as he doth what he had ſaid of the Rings belonging to the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 22.) then the meaning is, that the XII. Stones ſhould be the moſt ſparkling, and moſt perfect, in their kind, that could be got, (for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſignifies <hi>Fires</hi> or <hi>Illuminations;</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> the greateſt <hi>Perfection</hi>) and that all belonging to the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate (the <hi>Square ſtuff,</hi> the <hi>Stones</hi> engraved, the <hi>Rings,</hi> the <hi>Chains</hi> and <hi>Lace</hi>) ſhould be prepared and made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before they were ſet in the Breaſt-plate.</p>
               <p>And of this opinion (that the precious Stones were the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi>) were <hi>Joſephus</hi> and the <hi>Talmudick</hi> Doctors, who therein, I take it, were in the right; though they do not give a likely account how the mind of God was declared by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſhall be upon</hi> Aaron<hi>'s heart.</hi>] So it is ſaid concerning the Names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 29.) which were engraven on the XII. Stones; and ſeems to confirm the fore-going Interpretation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon his heart before the LORD.</hi>] He was never to appear in the Holy Place without this <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> with the Names of all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon it. Many learned Men have taken notice of that paſſage in <hi>Aelian, L.</hi> XIV. <hi>Var.

And <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 75. that it conſiſted of more precious Stones than one; from whence ſome have imagined that <hi>Moſes</hi> took his Pattern of this Breaſt-plate. But as they did not wear this Badge of Authority, when they miniſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sacred Things, but in their Civil Courts where they ſate as Judges; ſo there is no reaſon to think this Ornament of theirs, was ſo old as the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (there being no mention of it <hi>in Herodotus</hi>) but was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a later Invention, unto which other Countries were not Strangers. For the <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgins among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> at leaſt ſhe that was called <hi>Maxima,</hi> wore an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament upon her Breaſt made of precious Stones, as a Statue digged up at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the beginning of the laſt
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:60246:280"/>Century, ſeems to repreſent it, (See <hi>Lipſius cap. ult. de Veſta &amp; Veſtal.</hi>) And <hi>Gutherius</hi> hath proved that theſe <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgins ſate in Judgment, and tried Cauſes, as the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> did; and then it is likely, and not at other times, wore this <hi>Antepectorale.</hi> There is more ground alſo to ſay, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> took their Pattern from the <hi>Jews,</hi> than that they took it from the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> there being in the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> a great Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between them, by his marriage with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continually.</hi>] Whenſoever he appeared before the LORD, to enquire of him. The greateſt difficulty is, how the LORD anſwered by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim?</hi> Which the Jews generally think was by the ſhining of the Stones, and the prominence of ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in them, as made the Anſwer. If they had left out the latter part of this reſolution (about the prominence of the Letters) what they ſay would have been more likely. Eſpecially ſince <hi>Joſephus</hi> only mentions their extraordinary ſplendour; telling us, for inſtance, that when the High Prieſt enquired, whether they ſhould go to War or not? If God approved of it, there was ſuch a refulgent brightneſs in the Stones, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that made all the People know, God would be preſent for their help and ſuccour.</hi> And when God did not approve of their undertaking, he ſaith there was a <hi>cloudineſs</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stones, as there had been for two hundred years (he confeſſes) before he wrote his Hiſtory, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God being angry with them, for the tranſgreſſion of his Laws, L.</hi> III. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. c.</hi> 9. But this alone could not reſolve ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as that, I <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. <hi>Who ſhall go up firſt to ſight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Canaanites?</hi> To which the LORD anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) <hi>Judah ſhall go up.</hi> For if this Anſwer was
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:60246:281"/>given, in the way now mentioned, that Stone alone, which had the Name of <hi>Judah</hi> engraven on it, muſt have had a Splendor in it above all the reſt. Which if we ſhould ſuppoſe, yet an Anſwer could not have been given to all their queſtions, meerly by the Refulgency of all, or of any one Stone; as if they askt, <hi>Which way they ſhould go against an Enemy?</hi> Therefore it is more likely, that there was a Voice, which ſpake to the High Prieſt, from the Divine Glory, on the Mercy-ſeat; as we read there was to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he went into the moſt Holy Place to ſpeak with God, VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 89. Againſt which I do not ſee what can be objected: and it ſeems far more probable than their opinion, who think God inſpired the High Prieſt at that time, when he conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as he did the Prophets. For this makes no difference between enquiring by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and by the Prophets, but only this; That God (they ſay) conſtantly anſwered when the High Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him, which favour he did not always grant the Prophets. If there be any Truth alſo, in what the Jews ſay concerning the <hi>Bath-col</hi> under the ſecond Temple, it ſeems to me to tell us, That God then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them, without the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> in the ſame way as he had formerly done with it. Certain it is, that ſuch a Voice often ſpake to our Saviour, in the audience of his Apoſtles, out of the High and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Place in the Heavens; to ſhow that he was the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like unto Moſes,</hi> whom he promiſed to raiſe up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>There are thoſe who have adventured to affirm, That others beſides the High Prieſt might wear the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> to conſult the Divine Majeſty, particularly their Kings. But how weak the Grounds of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion are, will appear when I come to thoſe places, which they alledge to juſtifie it. I ſhall conclude what
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:60246:281"/>I have to note about this matter, with one Obſervation more; That this is one of the principal Reaſons, why the Government of this People before they had Kings, was (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls it) a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> that is, <hi>The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of God,</hi> becauſe he by this Oracle of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> preſcribed how they ſhould proceed in all their publick Affairs of great moment. And another Reaſon was, becauſe he ſtirred up <hi>Judges,</hi> when he thought it neceſſary; who being of his immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, are ſo far acknowledged by him, that when they were weary of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Government (who was a <hi>Judge</hi>) and deſired a King, God declared it was not <hi>Samuel</hi> whom they rejected, but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the Robe.</hi>] The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Mehil,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Robe,</hi> is by the Latins called <hi>Pallium,</hi> and by the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>And there ſhall be an hole in the top of it.</hi>] From hence the Form of it may be gathered, that it was like one of our <hi>Surplices,</hi> or <hi>Shirts</hi> without Sleeves; but with two holes on the ſides, to let their hands through. And it was put on over their Heads, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this hole at the top; and ſo covered their whole Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the midst thereof.</hi>] Not croſs-wiſe, from ſhoulder to ſhoulder; but long-wiſe, from the back to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the breaſt, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> expounds it. Wherein it differed from a Surplice, and from the <hi>Tunick,</hi> or <hi>Coat:</hi>
                  <pb n="556" facs="tcp:60246:282"/>the hole of which at the top, was round; whereas this was oblong, as they ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall have a binding.</hi>] This was both for handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for ſtrength, that it might not be further ſlit. <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions the former, as a reaſon for this <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>border,</hi> that there might appear no <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Of woven work.</hi>] It was not to be ſewed to it, but woven with it of one entire piece; which could not be done without a great deal of Art. So <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> the opening or <hi>hole</hi> was not to be cut with Sciſſars, and then ſewed with a Needle; but it was woven with the very Garment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As it were the hole of an Habergeon.</hi>] The ancient <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergions</hi> or <hi>Corſlets,</hi> being made of Leather and Linen, needed a <hi>Limbus</hi> about the Neck to keep the parts firm and tight. But whether the binding had hooks and eyes (as we call them) like thoſe which are in <hi>Corſlets,</hi> to faſten the parts together, is uncertain. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, but without any Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it be not rent.</hi>] That is, the Robe be not rent in putting it on; or by the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Breast-plate</hi> that were upon it; for that had rendred it contemptible; a Rent among us (ſaith <hi>R.

For he repreſents <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> as ſaying to <hi>Haman, Go to my Wardrobe, and take one of my best purple Cloaks, and of the best ſilk Veſts, with Gems at the four corners of it, and golden Bells and Pomegranates hanging round about.</hi> And no doubt they were intended partly as an Ornament to the High Prieſt, their Matter being of Gold; but what their Form was, we are not told. There were round Bells in uſe amongſt them, like thoſe which we commonly ſee upon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of our Horſes Necks: but <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith theſe were of a Pyramidal Figure, open at the bottom, with <hi>Clappers</hi> in them, like our little hand Bells.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the bottom,</hi> &amp;c.] So there was a Bell (as the Jews explain it) between every two Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates; and a Pomegranate between every two Bells. But how many of each there was, is uncertain; though the Jews commonly ſay there were LXXII. Which if it was true, and the Pomegranates were of ſuch a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as was ſaid before; this Robe would have been ſo wide at the bottom, as to have been cumberſom, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with ſo many Pomegranates and Bells, hanging upon it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>And it ſhall be unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>to miniſter.</hi>] He was never to appear before God without this Garment; nor to wear it but when he Miniſtred. The ſame is

                  <hi>That he die not.</hi>] For neglecting to appear before God, in this ſolemn manner, as he required. For it is the common Maxim among the Jews, That <hi>when the Prieſts were clothed with their Garments, they were held to be Prieſts; when they were not ſo clothed, they were not Prieſts.</hi> That is, if they preſumed to miniſter without this Attire, it was an illegal act, and unacceptable to God.

                  <hi>And grave upon it like the engravings of a ſignet.</hi>] Not by cutting the Letter deep in the Plate, but by making them protuberant, like thoſe which are made by a Seal upon Wax. See <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</hi>] The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Crowns perhaps had ſome image or other in them (for in later times <hi>Domitian</hi> had a golden Crown with the Effigies of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us) inſtead of which God commands his own great Name to be engraven on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Crown, in theſe words; which ſignifie, that he was <hi>Separated to the Service of the most High.</hi> It is but a frivolous queſtion which the Jews make, Whether theſe words were engraven in one Line, or in two, one above another? For there is no reaſon to make us think they were not in one Line, as they are here written.</p>
               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>And thou ſhalt put it on a blue Lace.</hi>] It hung on a Riband of blue, by which it was faſtned upon the Mitre, as it follows in the next words. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> fancy there were <hi>three</hi> Ribands; one at each ear, and one in the middle; which is this here mentioned. But this one was ſufficient for the purpoſe, as will appear when the next words are rightly underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it may be upon the Mitre.</hi>] There was an order before for making a <hi>Mitre,</hi> among other Veſtments: but we have not been told hitherto, of what it was made (which is mentioned below <hi>v.</hi> 39.) nor what was the Form of it. The Latins anciently called it <hi>Strop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> which is the ſame with the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; being a fillet wound about the head of their Prieſts, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> tells us. <hi>Prudentius</hi> calls it <hi>tortum infulam,</hi> becauſe it was made ſometimes of three or four Ribands or Laces wreathed together, <hi>vid. Cuperus</hi> in his <hi>Apotheoſis Homeri, p.</hi> 138. The ancient Greeks call it <hi>Tiara,</hi> and <hi>Cidaris,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Diadema;</hi> which was commonly made
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:60246:284"/>of <hi>byſſus</hi> or fine Linen, as appears even from the ſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who (as <hi>Juſtin</hi> tells us) took his Diadem from his Head, to bind up the Wounds of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus, L.</hi> XV. which ſhows that it was made of fine Linen, which was proper for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>They were of divers Colours, but commonly white: and ſuch were the <hi>Diadems</hi> of Kings, which <hi>Ammianus</hi> calls <hi>faſciolam candidam regiae majeſtatis inſigne, L.</hi> XII. Such was the <hi>Mitre</hi> of the High Prieſt (<hi>v.</hi> 39.) and the <hi>Bonnets</hi> of the lower Prieſts. The former of which they called <hi>Mitznephet,</hi> and the other <hi>Migbaoth.</hi> They did not differ at all in their Matter, but only in their Form. Both conſiſted of ſixteen Ells of fine Linnen, as the Hebrew Doctors agree; but do not tell us of what breadth: which might be wrapt round ſeveral times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout into what Form they pleaſed. And the <hi>Migbaoth</hi> or <hi>Bonnets,</hi> they all ſay, came lower down upon the forehead, than the <hi>Mitre;</hi> and roſe up higher, like an Hillock. But the <hi>Mitznephet</hi> did not cover the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head at all, and was flatter than the Bonnets, but much broader, conſiſting of more folds round; like the <hi>Turbants</hi> which are now worn in the Eaſt, or like an <hi>half Sphere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſome underſtand theſe words, <hi>that it may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mitre,</hi> as if the golden Plate was bound upon the Mitre; which is contrary to what follows <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>it ſhall be upon</hi> Aaron<hi>'s forehead.</hi> This therefore muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Lace</hi> or <hi>Riband,</hi> which was to come down over the Mitre, to faſten the golden Plate, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it. For being put through a little hole in the middle of the Plate, it went over the Mitre; and each end of it being put into the holes of the Plate, which were at each ear, it was brought up again, and tied over the Mitre. Thus we muſt interpret it, if there was but one ſtring to faſten it. It cannot be denied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:60246:284"/>that ſometimes more than one thing of a kind is intended, where the Scripture ſpeaks in the ſingular Number (as in VIII. 21. X. 4, &amp;c.) and therefore we may conceive, as I ſaid before, that there were three Ribands, one at each end, and another in the middle, by which it hung upon the forehead; whereby they might more eaſily be faſtned at the top of the Mitre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the forefront of the Mitre it ſhall be.</hi>] That is, the golden Plate ſhall be in the forefront of it. By which it appears that the Hebrew Doctors rightly deſcribed it, as reaching before from ear to ear; but no part of it behind. That is, it was an half-circle, not an whole; incompaſſing only the fore-part of the Head, not like other Crowns that incompaſs it round.</p>
               <p>Ver. 38. <hi>And it ſhall be upon</hi> Aarons <hi>forehead.</hi>] The <hi>Mitre,</hi> as I ſaid before, did not come down low (as the <hi>Bonnets</hi> did) but only covered the Crown and the upper part of the Head; the whole forehead being left bare, that there might be ſpace enough for this Plate of Gold to lye upon it; and for his <hi>Philacteries,</hi> as the Jews will have it, which were next to the Mitre, and then the Crown, a little above the Eyes. But ſome of them think the High Prieſt wore no <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> having no need of them, when he was clothed with ſo many holy Garments. But, not to trouble our ſelves with that, it appears by theſe words, that the Plate did not lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mitre, but upon the High Prieſts forehead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Aaron <hi>may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall hallow in all their gifts.</hi>] Theſe words ſuppoſe there might be ſome defects in their Sacrifices and Gifts, which they conſecrated and preſented unto God (though they were ignorant of it) which were all pardoned (for that's meant by <hi>bearing,</hi> that is, taking away iniquity) by the Interceſſion of their High Prieſt, when he appeared before God with
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:60246:285"/>this Crown upon his Head, that is, thus perfectly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly attired. Wherein he repreſented our great High Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus; by whoſe perfect Sanctity and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, all the Defects of our ſincere Services are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be always upon his forehead.</hi>] That is, whenſoever he went in to miniſter in the Holy Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he may be accepted before the LORD.</hi>] That the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> might be accepted when they preſented them to God; which they were not, if the High Prieſt did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him, in this manner, on their behalf. The Heathens themſelves (as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> informs us, <hi>L.</hi> XV. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) thought Prayers and Sacrifices then acceptable to their Gods, when they offered them with Crowns on their Heads. And therefore a great many Authors tell us the Prieſts in all Countries, were crowned when they miniſtred; nay, the Sacrifices themſelves, and their Altars, and their holy Utenſils were crown'd; as if all their Services had been ineffectual, if made without a Crown. For they that prepared the Beaſts for Sacrifice, and the Muſicians, and all that were preſent were crowned, as appears out of ancient Coins and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ancient Writers. See <hi>Cuperus Apotheoſ. Hom. p.</hi> 70.</p>
               <p>Ver. 39. <hi>And thou ſhalt embroider the Coat of fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</hi>] This <hi>Coat</hi> is one of the Garments ordered to be made <hi>v.</hi> 4. in Hebrew called <hi>Ketonah:</hi> from whence both the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latin <hi>Tunica</hi> ſeem to be derived. The Matter of it was <hi>fine Linen;</hi> and therefore it was white. The Form of it was not much unlike one of our Shirts, with Sleeves coming down to the wriſts; but made pretty cloſe to the Body, and ſo long as to reach down to the heels. It was the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all the Prieſtly Garments, being next to their
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:60246:285"/>Body. And, though it be not mentioned in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, there is no doubt, that it had a ſlit in the neck of it, by which it was put over their head, and then tied to the neck with ſtrings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Embroidered.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Taſchbetz</hi> all agree ſignifies a work with certain Figures woven in it, either of Gold, or other Materials. But what ſort of Figure, is not certain. The famous <hi>Salmaſius</hi> thinks they were round, like to our Eyes. Others take them to have been ſquare or cubical. <hi>R. Sol. Jarchi</hi> ſaith in general, that it was a work like the <hi>Ouches</hi> (as we tranſlate <hi>Miſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betzoth</hi>) in which the precious Stones were ſet. But none, I think, hath made ſuch likely gueſſes at the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of them as <hi>Jo. Braunius,</hi> who takes them to have been nothing elſe, but <hi>lacus aut foſſulas angulares,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch little deep holes, as reſemble thoſe that are in one of the Stomachs of thoſe Animals that chew the Cud, called <hi>Reticulum.</hi> See <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Veſtitu Sacerd.

               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt make the Mitre of Linen.</hi>] See <hi>v.</hi> 37. where the Mitre is mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt make the girdle of needle-work.</hi>] It is mentioned before <hi>v.</hi> 4. under the name of <hi>Abanet</hi> or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> which no doubt ſignifies a <hi>Girdle</hi> or <hi>Belt;</hi> yet not like our common Girdles, but like that which we call a <hi>Schaſh,</hi> being made of twined Linen, and Worſted of divers colours, as we find XXXIX. 29. where <hi>blue, and purple, and ſcarlet</hi> ſignifies Wooll, or Worſted-yarn of theſe colours. Such were the Girdles of all the Prieſts, which they wore all the year, the High Prieſt as well as the reſt; except upon one day (that of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi>) when he had on a Girdle of fine Linen only, not mixed with Woollen. Theſe Girdles were of ſuch a length, that they might go round the Body more than once, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 8. For, if
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:60246:286"/>we may believe him, they were <hi>Two and thirty</hi> Ells long, and four Fingers broad, being hollow within. When they were not in the Act of Miniſtration, both ends of them hung down to their very feet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. (as the ſame <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>for comelineſs ſake, that they might appear more goodly to the beholders:</hi> which agrees to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the next Verſe, that they (as all the Prieſtly Garments, <hi>v.</hi> 2.) were made <hi>for glory and beauty.</hi> But when they went about any holy work, belonging to their Office, they threw them over their left ſhoulder, that they might not be an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to them. The uſe of this <hi>Girdle</hi> was to girt their <hi>Coat</hi> cloſe to them; which they tuckt up alſo in the Girdle (when they went about their Miniſtry) to the middle of their Leggs, that it might not incumber them in their Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of needle-work.</hi>] This was a different ſort of work from <hi>Taſchbetz</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>broidered,</hi> v. 4.) and from <hi>Choſcheb</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>cunning,</hi> v. 6, 15.) and is here called <hi>Rokem.</hi> Which ſignifies the ſame with <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> as to the variety of Colours and Figures in the Work: but <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> as the Hebrew Doctors tell us, was done by weaving, and <hi>Rokem</hi> with a Needle, as we rightly take it. Of the two <hi>Choſcheb</hi> was the moſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, as the word ſeems to intimate; being wrought on both ſides with the ſame Figures, whereas <hi>Rokem</hi> was only on one ſide. This they gather from XXVI. 31. where the <hi>Vail</hi> is ordered to be made of the Work called <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> which it's probable was glorious on both ſides, both within and without the moſt Holy Place. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaith this Girdle was wrought with Flowers of the ſeveral Colours mentioned XXXIX. 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 40. <hi>And for</hi> Aarons <hi>ſons thou ſhalt make Coats.</hi>] The Coats of all the Prieſts, as well as of the High Prieſt, were embroidered, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſly affirms.
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:60246:286"/>And it ſeems to be the ſenſe of <hi>v.</hi> 4. where he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make Garments not only for <hi>Aaron,</hi> but for his Sons (<hi>i. e.</hi> all the reſt of the Prieſts) among which the <hi>broidered Coat,</hi> may well be thought to belong to them. See XXXIX. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt make for them girdles.</hi>] The Girdles of the inferiour Prieſts, were the very ſame with that of the High Prieſt, (as well as their Tunicks or Coats) being to bind their Coats to their Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bonnets.</hi>] How theſe differed from the <hi>Mitre</hi> of the High Prieſt, in their Form, not in their Matter, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For glory and for beauty.</hi>] The Garments of all the Prieſts were contrived to make them appear in a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and comly manner, when they miniſtred to the glorious Majeſty of God, being of ſine Linen, which was worn by the greateſt Perſons, made with great Art, eſpecially their Coats and Girdles, which were finely adorned (as I have ſhown in the Verſes foregoing) with elegant Figures, and rich Colours: for <hi>blue,</hi> or sky-colour, <hi>purple</hi> and <hi>ſcarlet</hi> belonged to Kings and Perſons of Honour.

For beſides thoſe common to him with all the Prieſts, which were very coſtly, he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers far more precious: particularly the <hi>Ephod</hi> and its Girdle, the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> ſet with Stones of great value, the <hi>Robe,</hi> and the <hi>Crown of Gold.</hi> The two Stones alſo on the ſhoulders of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> were not only precious in their kind, but for their bigneſs; being ſo large that. Twelve Names were engraven in them, containing <hi>Six and thirty</hi> Letters. All which conſidered, <hi>Philo</hi> had reaſon to ſay <hi>(L. de Sacerd.

<pb n="566" facs="tcp:60246:287"/>in old time was ſo honourable, that Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſcharged it: which is the reaſon that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Princes and Prieſts have the ſame Name of <hi>Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I may add, That they took ſuch care all their Garments ſhould be <hi>for glory and beauty,</hi> that when they were foul they did not waſh them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair them when they had any breach in them: but new ones were bought, and the old imployed about the Lamps in the Feaſt of Tabernacles.

VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And conſecrate them.</hi>] By the Sacrifice of a Ram, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Ram of Conſecration;</hi> the Blood of which he put <hi>upon the tip of their right ear,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſanctifie them.</hi>] By the foregoing Ceremonies. For they were ſet apart to the Divine Service, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on their Garments, anointing them, and offering the Sacrifice of Conſecration, and by waſhing them with Water, as appears from VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 6, 7, 12. where it is ſaid he anointed <hi>Aaron,</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie him;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 30. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſprinkled their Garments, it is ſaid, <hi>he ſanctified</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 42. <hi>And thou ſhalt make them linen breeches.</hi>] Though theſe are mentioned in the laſt place, yet they were put on the firſt of all the Prieſts Garments; after them the <hi>Coat,</hi> which being girt about with the <hi>Girdle,</hi> the <hi>Bonnet</hi> was put upon the Prieſt's head. The High Prieſt, in like manner, having put on his Breeches, Coat and Girdle (which were common to all Prieſts) was clothed with his <hi>Robe,</hi> and next with the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> which were inſeparable; and laſt of all with his <hi>Mitre</hi> and the <hi>golden Crown.</hi> To which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nature it ſelf directed them; the inward Garments being always put on before the outward.</p>
               <p>Now as to theſe <hi>Mikneſe,</hi> which we truly render <hi>Breeches,</hi> the Matter of them was Linen, as we are here informed: and not ordinary <hi>Linen,</hi> but that which the Hebrews call <hi>Scheſch,</hi> which was <hi>fine Linen;</hi> and more than that, they were of <hi>twined</hi> (or ſix-threded) <hi>Linen,</hi> as we read XXXIX. 28. They were made with great Art, being woven of one piece, and not ſewed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us. The Form of them was like our <hi>Breeches</hi> or <hi>Drawers,</hi> which may be the reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> here uſes a word of the <hi>dual</hi> Number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had two parts, which covered each Thigh diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To cover their nakedneſs.</hi>] This was oppoſed, as <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> thinks, to the idolatrous Worſhip of <hi>Peor;</hi> which, if we may believe him, was ſo beaſtly, that it was performed by diſcovery of their Nakedneſs, <hi>More Nevoch.

               <p>
                  <hi>From the Loins even to the Thighs they ſhall reach.</hi>] They were bound about the Loins with Strings, which ran through the top of them, that they might be drawn ſtraiter, or looſer as they pleaſed; and came down the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:60246:288"/>Thighs, as far as to their Knees. There were ſome <hi>Breeches</hi> anciently, which covered the Leggs alſo, and came down to the Feet, ſuch as Sailers uſe in cold Countries: but theſe did not come down ſo low; the intention of them being only to cover thoſe Parts (as it goes before) which ought not to be expoſed. For though they had a Coat over their whole Body, yet that being looſe and wide below, by ſome accident or other, thoſe Parts might have been ſeen which ought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, if that had not been prevented by theſe Drawers, which ſo covered the lower Parts, that nothing could poſſibly be ſeen. For in this they differed from our Drawers, that they had no opening, either behind or before. Some think before this time there were no ſuch thing as <hi>Breeches</hi> in uſe among the Hebrews; nor after this, among any other Men, but the Prieſts in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. But in latter Ages they came in uſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from III <hi>Dan.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Ver. 43. <hi>And they ſhall be upon</hi> Aaron, <hi>and upon his ſons, when they come in unto the Tabernacle, or when they come near unto the Altar to miniſter in the holy place.</hi>] They could not be permitted ſo much as to appear in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> much leſs to <hi>miniſter,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> without their <hi>holy Vestments.</hi> Which they wore there only, but in no other place: for at home, or abroad, or in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and all other places out of the Temple, they wore common Garments, ſuch as other Men did. Inſomuch that St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the High Prieſt, when he ſate in the Court by his Habit from other Judges, XXIII <hi>Acts</hi> 5. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we read XLII <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. XLIV. 17, 18, 19. an expreſs Precept for putting off the Prieſts Garments, and laying them up in the Chambers appointed for that purpoſe, when they went out of the Court where they miniſtred. The High Prieſt, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> informs
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:60246:288"/>us, had a Chamber, or <hi>Veſtry</hi> peculiar to himſelf, where his Garments were laid up, when he put them off, as the <hi>Robes</hi> of Kings are in their Wardrobe. Of this one cannot reaſonably doubt, that they being not only precious, but ſacred things, were kept ſafe in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was an holy place. And ſo were the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Inferiour Prieſts, as we may learn from <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> who, among other things put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaſury, mention a certain number of Prieſts Garments, II <hi>Ezra</hi> 69. VII <hi>Nehem.</hi> 70. In their <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries</hi> alſo there were peculiar Cheſts, where every ſort of Veſtment were kept by themſelves. All the <hi>Breeches,</hi> for inſtance, which had this Inſcription <hi>Mikneſe,</hi> i. e. Breeches. In like manner all the <hi>Coats</hi> and the <hi>Bonnets</hi> had two diſtinct Cheſts with this Inſcription, <hi>Ketonoth</hi> and <hi>Migbaoth:</hi> and ſo had the reſt, as we are told in the <hi>Miſna Tamid c.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>But while they were in the Temple they might keep on their holy Garments (only not ſleep in them there) even at thoſe hours when they did not miniſter. Which this Text ſeems to ſuppoſe, when it ſaith, they ſhall be upon them, <hi>when they come into the Tabernacle,</hi> as well as <hi>when they come near unto the Altar to miniſter.</hi> Thus the <hi>Talmudiſts;</hi> In the Temple they might keep on their Garments, <hi>whether in the time of their Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or out of it.</hi> But this they underſtand only of their <hi>Breeches,</hi> their <hi>Coat</hi> and <hi>Bonnet:</hi> for their <hi>Girdle</hi> they were bound to lay aſide as ſoon as they had done Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they bear not iniquity and die.</hi>] That God do not puniſh them with Death, for being ſo prophane as to appear before him, without their holy Garments, which he appointed to preſerve his Service from contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall be a ſtatute for ever unto him, and his ſeed after him.</hi>] That is, as long as there ſhall be any Prieſts of
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:60246:289"/>the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> they ſhall appear before God in theſe Garments. But that Prieſthood being aboliſhed, by the true eternal Prieſthood of Chriſt, there is no longer any uſe of them; no more than of the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thoſe Prieſts offered, which are compleated in the Sacrifice of Chriſt. As for the Jewiſh ſenſe of theſe words, it is manifeſt, that it hath been long confuted; there having been no Prieſthood, nor holy Garments, nor Sacrifices, no nor Temple among them, for above Sixteen hundred years. Nay, before the coming of our Saviour, ſome of the Prieſtly Ornaments, and thoſe the chief of all, were gone, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> in the Breaſt-plate; which they generally confeſs were not in the ſecond Temple; and it may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether they continued to the end of the firſt. But the truth is, there was the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> as to its Matter and Form (though it had loſt its uſe, there being no Anſwers from God given by it) and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all the reſt of the Prieſtly Garments remained as long as there was any Prieſthood; which is the full ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>a ſtatute for ever to him, and his ſeed after him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To miniſter unto me in the Prieſts Office.</hi>] This was
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:60246:289"/>the deſign of their Separation from other Men, as was often ſaid before, XXVIII. 1, 3, 4, 41, 43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemiſh.</hi>] There were ſeveral things to be done before this, though this was the chief. For they were to be <hi>waſhed,</hi> and <hi>robed</hi> with their Prieſtly Garments, and <hi>anointed;</hi> and then they were compleated by peculiar Sacrifices, which are directed and deſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. and put in execution VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And unleavened bread,</hi> &amp;c.] Together with the foregoing Sacrifices (which it will appear hereafter were of ſeveral ſorts) there was a <hi>Mincha</hi> to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Bread being neceſſary at a Table together with Fleſh. And this conſiſted of <hi>three</hi> parts; <hi>unleavened Bread, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Cakes tempered with Oyl,</hi> and <hi>unleavened Wafers</hi> (or thin Cakes, like to our <hi>Pan-cakes</hi>) <hi>anointed with Oyl,</hi> before they were put into the Pan, to be fried. All theſe were to be made of <hi>wheaten flour:</hi> and the two laſt were accounted a delicious Bread among the Greeks, as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> tells us <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Deipnoſoph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And thou ſhalt put them into one basket,</hi> &amp;c.] All theſe making but one <hi>Meat-offering,</hi> were to be put into one Basket, and ſo brought to the door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to be preſented there to God together with the Bullock and Rams, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons thou ſhalt bring unto the door of the Tabernacle.</hi>] To be preſented unto God, together with their Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhalt waſh them with water.</hi>] This was the firſt thing that was done for <hi>the hallowing</hi> them (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) as we read VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. and was performed, ſome think, at the Laver, which is directed to be made in the next Chapter (XXX. 18, 19.) where they were to repeat this waſhing every time they went in to miniſter unto God. But now, I take it to be more likely, at their
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:60246:290"/>firſt Conſecration, Water was brought from thence to waſh them at the Door of the Tabernacle, before they were permitted to enter into it. Whether their whole Bodies were now waſhed, is not ſaid; but we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gather that they were; for they were now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as wholly unclean (being <hi>unhallowed</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be waſhed all over: though, being once cleanſed, they needed not do more, when they went to miniſter, but only waſh their hands and their feet. Which agrees with our Saviour's words, XIII <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. Such waſhings, every Body knows, were in uſe among the Gentiles, before they offered Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And thou ſhalt take the Garments.</hi>] Their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being waſhed, they were, next of all, <hi>robed</hi> with thoſe Garments preſcribed in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And put upon</hi> Aaron <hi>the coat, and the robe of the Ephod, and the Ephod,</hi> &amp;c.] The order wherein theſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were put on, according to the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> was this: Firſt the <hi>Breeches</hi> were put on by the Prieſt himſelf, and that privately; which is the reaſon perhaps they are not here mentioned. They being tied about his Loins <hi>Moſes</hi> put upon him the cloſe <hi>Coat,</hi> which came down to his Ankles. Then this being bound to him by the <hi>Girdle</hi> (which was round ſeveral times about him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-holes) he put upon him his <hi>Bonnet.</hi> This was the manner of habiting an ordinary Prieſt. But when the High Prieſt was conſecrated, after the <hi>Girdle</hi> before named, was put on the <hi>Robe,</hi> with the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> and then his <hi>Mitre;</hi> to which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Golden-plate,</hi> tied with a blue <hi>Riband</hi> upon his forehead. See <hi>Selden de Succeſſion. ad Pontif. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And put the holy Crown upon his head.</hi>] By this <hi>Crown</hi> is meant nothing elſe but the Golden-plate, on which was written <hi>Holineſs to the LORD,</hi> XXVIII. 36.
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:60246:290"/>Which is expreſly called by the name of a <hi>Crown,</hi> (XXXIX. 30. VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.) being bound upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with a blue Riband like a <hi>Diadem. Joſephus</hi> ſeems to call the Mitre by the name of a Crown, (<hi>L.</hi> VI. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. c.</hi> 15.) but then he immediately adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. about which there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Golden Crown, having holy Letters written in it, <hi>&amp;c. Vide Selden L.</hi> II. <hi>de Succeſſion. c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And thou ſhalt take the anointing Oyl.</hi>] The next thing that was done for the Conſecration of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> was anointing him with that Oyl which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be made, XXX. 31, 32, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And pour it upon his head and anoint him.</hi>] The Jews ſeem to think theſe two diſtinct things, <hi>pouring Oyl on his head,</hi> and then <hi>anointing him.</hi> The manner of which they ſay was thus: The Oyl being poured upon his head, which ran down to his face, he that anointed him drew with his Finger the figure of the Greek Letter <hi>Chi</hi> (or St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Croſs) upon his forehead between his Eye-brows. This was done, <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> thinks, before his Mitre was put upon his head. But that is contrary to the order here ſet down, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the putting on all his Prieſtly Garments (of which this was one) before the anointing. And he was therefore to be anointed in all his Habiliments, becauſe he was anointed to miniſter unto God; which he could not do without all the holy Garments (XXVIII. 43.) particularly this, it being unlawful to appear before God with the Head uncovered; as it was alſo among the Gentiles. Other of the Jewiſh Doctors therefore think, that when his Head was wrapt about with the Mitre, a place was left bare upon his Crown, for the pouring the Oyl upon it. Certain it is, that it was ſo poured on his Head, as to run down upon his Beard, CXXXIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. And the Jew ſays the form of the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:60246:291"/>Letter <hi>Chi,</hi> was drawn upon his forehead, to diſtinguiſh his anointing, from that of their Kings; who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed in the ſorm of a Circle or Crown. See <hi>Selden de Succeſſion. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 9. Where he obſerves alſo, that there being no holy Oyl, all the time of the ſecond Temple after the Captivity, they made High Prieſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by putting on their holy Garments. Which that they might have compleat, they made an imitation of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> (though they had not the Oracle it ſelf) that none of the eight Garments might be wanting. So <hi>Maimonides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only remaining difficulty is, Whether all <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons were anointed as well as himſelf. And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the place before-named, thinks they were at the firſt, but not in future times: though all <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Succeſſors in the High Prieſthood were conſecrated by anointing, as long as the holy Oyl laſted; that is, to the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or as ſome ſay <hi>fifty</hi> years before, when it was hid and no more found. And there is a place in the next Chapter, which ſeems to favour this Opinion, XXX. 30. But as we read of no Command for <hi>their</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, as there is here for <hi>Aaron</hi>'s: ſo when this Command came to be executed, it is ſaid expreſly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> poured Oyl on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head; but that upon his Sons he only put the holy Garments, VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 12, 13. And therefore he is peculiarly called, <hi>The High Priest from among his Brethren, upon whoſe Head the anointing Oyl was poured,</hi> XXI <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. The anointing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his Sons, XXX. 30. is only meant of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is here mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 21. of this Chapter, where a mixture is ordered to be made of the Blood of the Sacrifice and of the anointing Oyl, which was order'd to be ſprinkled both upon <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Garments, and was a part of their Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it was done accordingly at that time, as we
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:60246:291"/>read VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 30. So that <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf had a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Unction; one proper to him alone, as High Prieſt, upon whoſe Head the holy Oyl was poured; another common to him with his Sons, as he was a Prieſt, whoſe Garments were ſprinkled with the Oyl and Blood min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And thou ſhalt bring his ſons, and put coats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi>] The High Prieſt was firſt habited, and then his Sons, in the order I have deſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt gird them with girdles,</hi> &amp;c.] See <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Prieſts office ſhall be theirs,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, as long as the holy Garments were upon them, the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was upon them: but if they were not upon them, neither was the Prieſthood upon them. They are the words of <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>Celi Hammikdaſh, c.</hi> 10. Or the meaning may be, they ſhall enjoy, in perpetual Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Office of Prieſts, as their Father and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the Office of High Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt conſecrate</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons.</hi>] Thus doing, they ſhall be compleatly conſecrated. For in the Hebrew the phraſe is, <hi>Shall fill the hand of</hi> Aaron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was done after the manner preſcribed <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which ſhows that this was the principal part of their Conſecration; or at leaſt, the conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And there was beſides this, a peculiar Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which both <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons are commanded to offer, in the day of their anointing, VI <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And thou ſhalt cauſe a bullock.</hi>] The <hi>young bullock</hi> he commanded him to take <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be brought before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] In order to its being offered to God: for in this and in the following Verſes, the Sacrifices are preſcribed which were to be made at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:60246:292"/>Sons; which were three: The firſt is this here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which was an <hi>Offering for Sin,</hi> as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 14. For till their Sins were expiated, they were not fit to offer any thing to God; much leſs to offer for the Sins of others. The next was an <hi>Holocaust,</hi> or whole Burnt-offering, as a Gift or Preſent, whereby they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to God. And the third was a <hi>Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> on which they made a Feaſt, and by that were initiated into God's Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons ſhall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.</hi>] This was the form in all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, both <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> I <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. and <hi>Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> III <hi>Lev.</hi> 2, 8. by which they devoted the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be the LORD's. But in <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Solemn Confeſſion of Sins made (XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.) he that laid his hands on the Beaſt, ſeemed thereby to have transferred the Guilt from himſelf, unto the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, deſiring it might be accepted for him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And thou ſhalt kill the bullock before the LORD.</hi>] Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was never Conſecrated after the manner of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet he was made a Prieſt, for this peculiar purpoſe, by an extraordinary Commiſſion from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] Where the Altar of Burnt-offering was placed, at the crection of the Tabernacle, XL. 6, 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And thou ſhalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the Altar with thy finger.</hi>] Some have fancied that he means, <hi>upon the horns of the Altar of Incenſe;</hi> becauſe when a Prieſt offered a Sin-offering for himſelf, he was ſo to do, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. But it is to be conſidered that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, for whom this Sacrifice was offered, were not yet Prieſts, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Men, who by this Sacrifice were to be made Prieſts. Whoſe blood therefore was to be put upon the <hi>horns of the Altar of Burnt-offering,</hi> as is expreſly required in other Sin-offerings, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 25, 30.</p>
               <pb n="577" facs="tcp:60246:292"/>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Beſide the bottom of the Altar.</hi>] This ſhows he ſpeaks of the Altar of Burnt-offering; at the bottom of which there was a Trench, into which they poured the Blood of the Sacrifice, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And thou ſhalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards.</hi>] He means that part of the Beaſt which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Omentum,</hi> in which all the Bowels are wrapped; which in IX <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. is ſimply called <hi>that which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> This hath a great deal of fat upon it to keep the Bowels warm, and was much uſed in ancient Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who herein followed the <hi>Jews.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo offered to the Gods nothing but the <hi>Omentum,</hi> or a part of it, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Strabo.</hi> See <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 45. And from the Condition and Situation of the <hi>Omentum</hi> the Heathen Diviners made their Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; inſomuch that ſome think it had the name of <hi>Omentum,</hi> becauſe they made their good or bad <hi>Omens</hi> from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Caul that is above the Liver.</hi>] Our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters take this for the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> or the <hi>Midriff,</hi> upon which the Liver hangs. But <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I think, that it ſignifies the greateſt lobe of the Liver, upon which the Bladder of Gall lies, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 45. The only Argument againſt it is, that this <hi>Jothereth</hi> (as the Hebrews call it) is ſaid here to be <hi>above the Liver;</hi> and therefore muſt ſignifie the <hi>Diophragm,</hi> upon which the Liver depends. But the Particle <hi>Al</hi> ſignifies <hi>upon,</hi> as well as <hi>above:</hi> and is to be here ſo tranſlated <hi>upon</hi> or <hi>by the Liver.</hi> And the reaſon why this <hi>lobe</hi> of the Liver was peculiar to the Altar, was becauſe of the fat that is upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the two Kidneys,</hi> &amp;c.] For the ſame reaſon the Kidneys were appropriated to God: which had one of
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:60246:293"/>their names from the fat that is upon them, which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> (as the ſame <hi>Bochartus</hi> there obſerves) calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the fleſh of the bullock and his skin,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> being flead, the skin of it was given to the Prieſt, VII <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. But in <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> the skin was burnt (and the Fleſh alſo in ſome caſes) and that alſo without the Camp, not at the Altar, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 11, 12. VIII. 17. The Heathen ſometimes burnt the skin even of their Holocauſts, as <hi>Bochart.</hi> ſhews, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shalt thou burn with fire,</hi> &amp;c.] The Hebrew word here for <hi>burn</hi> is quite different from that in the foregoing Verſe, which is uſed concerning the burning of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> which ſoon vaniſhed into ſmoke, as the <hi>fat</hi> there mentioned did. But the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>skin,</hi> and the <hi>dung,</hi> were burnt with a ſtronger fire, and were longer before they were conſumed; and therefore burnt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp,</hi> where the Aſhes were poured out, as a thing abominable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a Sin-offering.</hi>] The Prieſt might eat of any <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> whoſe Blood was not brought into the Sanctuary; or rather it was his Duty ſo to do (X <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.) becauſe it argued that the Peoples Sin was born and taken away by the Prieſt. It may ſeem ſtrange then that <hi>Moſes</hi> (who was in the place of a Prieſt) is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to burn all this Sin-offering, and not permitted to eat of it; though <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons could not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not yet Prieſts. The beſt reaſon I have found of it is, that it was to ſignifie the imperfection of the Legal Diſpenſation; ſince the Sins of the Prieſts themſelves could not be taken away, by the Prieſts of the Law, or their Sacrifices; but were to expect a better Sacrifice, or a better High Prieſt, as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s words are in his <hi>Conſecration of the Son of God, c.</hi> 26. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the hands of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and in the hands of his Sons.</hi>] Thence this Sacrifice was called <hi>Milluim,</hi> that is, <hi>filling of the hands;</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Conſecration.</hi> And their
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:60246:295"/>hands were thus <hi>filled,</hi> to ſhow that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons did not uſurp this dignity, or take it upon themſelves (as we ſpeak) but were called unto it by God, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theſe things to be put into their hands, that they might preſent them to him. <hi>R. Solomon</hi> will have this Ram called <hi>the Ram of ſillings</hi> or <hi>impletions;</hi> becauſe by this Sacrifice they were compleated, and abſolutely made Prieſts; nothing remaining to be done after this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhalt wave them.</hi>] When ſuch holy things were put into the Heads of the Offerers by the Prieſt, then the Prieſt put his hands under theirs, and they were lifted up, and then waved about on all ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a Wave-offering.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Tenuphah</hi> ſignifies <hi>agitation,</hi> or ſhaking to and fro; which <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binel</hi> ſaith, was performed upward and downward, and then round about to all quarters of the World, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that <hi>the Earth is the LORD's, and the fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> or, rather that he is the <hi>poſſeſſor of Heaven and of Earth.</hi> Others of them ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For a Burnt-offering.</hi>] It is certain this was not an whole Burnt-offering, but a Peace-offering, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 28, 31, 32. yet ſome of it being burnt on the Altar, that part is called a Burnt-offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an Offering made by fire.</hi>] So the Burnt-offerings are called I <hi>Lev.</hi> 9, 13, &amp;c. but this was ſo only in part, as I ſaid, not in the whole; and may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by III <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. where all that was to be burnt of the Peace-offerings, is commanded to be <hi>burnt upon the Burnt-Sacrifice,</hi> and in that regard might be called a <hi>Burnt-offering.</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And wave it for a Wave-offering before the LORD; and it ſhall be thy part.</hi>] Being a <hi>Peace-offering,</hi> the Prieſt who offered the Sacrifice, was to have his ſhare of it: and therefore the Breaſt is here given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> after he had acknowledged it to be God's by waving it about, and that he had it only as his Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſanctifie the breast of the Wave-offering, and the ſhoulder of the Heave-offering.</hi>] Upon this occaſion, he makes a general Law, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved hereafter; That, though in this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Caſe, the <hi>right ſhoulder</hi> of this Sacrifice was burnt, (being for <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Conſecration) and called a <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> v. 25. yet in all future times, both the Breaſt and this Shoulder ſhould belong unto the Prieſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word <hi>ſanctifie</hi> here ſignifies, as much as declare them to be ſanctified, or ſet apart for the Prieſts uſe; as they were again by an expreſs Law, VII <hi>Lev.</hi> 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is waved, and which is heaved up.</hi>] There is no difference, that I can find, between <hi>Terumah</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Heave-offering,</hi> and <hi>Tenuphah</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Wave-offering;</hi> but the former was only lifted up, and ſo waved; and the other was waved all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways, up and down, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, to ſignifie that he to whom it was offered, was Lord of the whole World, and all that therein is.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And it ſhall be</hi> Aarons <hi>and his Sons by a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for ever.</hi>] So it is called VII <hi>Lev.</hi> 34. and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated for greater confirmation, XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is an Heave-offering.</hi>] It is conſecrated to God, to whom it belongs; and he beſtows it upon his Miniſters.</p>
               <pb n="585" facs="tcp:60246:296"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be an Heave-offering of the Sacrifice of their Peace-offerings,</hi> &amp;c.] And it ſhall always in future times be preſented unto God, as his part of the <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> who conſtitutes the Prieſts to eat it in his ſtead. As the former Ram was a <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> ſo this, it is plain, was a <hi>Peace-offering,</hi> in token, that now they were in a ſtate of perfect Friendſhip with God. Which was procured by their Sin-offering (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) which was offered firſt; whereby their <hi>Preſent</hi> to God (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) was made acceptable, as now their <hi>Perſons</hi> were declared by this Sacrifice of Peace-offering.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And the holy Garments of</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall be his Sons after him, to be anointed therein,</hi> &amp;c.] Upon this occaſion alſo, God makes another general Law, That all the Succeſſors of <hi>Aaron</hi> in the High Prieſthood, ſhould be ſet apart to that Office, in ſuch Garments, and by ſuch an Unction, and ſuch Sacrifices as he was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated withal. And it appears by XX <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Son was inveſted with the very ſame Garments which <hi>Aaron</hi> wore: for thoſe which peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the High Prieſt, did not decay as the Tunick and Breeches did, and therefore went from one to another.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And that Son which is Priest in his ſtead, ſhall put them on ſeven days.</hi>] This was to be done ſeven days, one after another, that a Sabbath might paſs over him. For no Man could be a compleat High Prieſt, as the Jews imagine, till a Sabbath had gone over his head. But the principal intention of this was, that he might be made a Prieſt with great Solemnity and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; and put on his Habit ſo often, that he may learn how to appear in them after a decent, or rather magnificent manner, before he undertook to Miniſter. Yet the Jews ſay, that if he did offer Sacrifice before the ſeven days end, it was not accounted unlawful; provided he had been anointed, and had put them on
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:60246:297"/>once. So <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who adds that he was to put them on by day, and not by Night. See <hi>Selden de Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſionibus, L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 8. Where he ſhows (<hi>cap.</hi> 9.) this is to be underſtood of his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> alſo, which was to be by day, and not by night; and to be repeated ſeven times. And by the ſame reaſon, the Sacrifices were alſo to be repeated; though if he miniſtred before they were offered, the Doctors held it not to be illegitimate; as he ſhows in the end of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he cometh into the Tabernacle of the Congreation, to miniſter in the holy place.</hi>] At this entrance into the Tabernacle he was to put them on for ſeven days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before he could go to miniſter in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And thou ſhalt take the Ram of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>] That is, all the reſt of the Fleſh, which was not burnt on the Altar, nor given to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who having had their ſhare (<hi>v.</hi> 22, 26.) the Remainder, as the manner was in <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> belonged to thoſe that brought the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſeethe his fleſh in the holy place.</hi>] At the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, as we read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 31. and as it is explained in the next Verſe, that there they ſhould eat it. Fire was taken from the Altar to boil it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons ſhall cat the fleſh of the Ram.</hi>] That is, Feaſt with God in his own Houſe, as Perſons now compleatly qualified to miniſter unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the bread that is in the basket.</hi>] All the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread and Cakes, which were preſented unto God, after that which was burnt upon the Altar, as his part, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] Hence it appears, that this Sacrifice had ſomething in it peculiar, from other <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> which might be
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:60246:297"/>carried home and eaten there, after God and the Prieſts had had their parts. But this was to be eaten in God's own Houſe, where they were Miniſters, as a thing more holy: and therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons and Daughters could not eat of it, as all the Family did of other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of this kind.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>And they ſhall eat thoſe things.</hi>] <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons alone were to eat them; and no Body elſe with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherewith the atonement was made.</hi>] The atonement was not made by theſe things, but by the <hi>Bullock,</hi> which was offered in the firſt place; which made them fit to have their <hi>hands filled</hi> with theſe things (as the Hebrew phraſe is for Conſecrating) <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. to compleat their Sanctification. And therefore the words ſhould be thus tranſlated, <hi>They ſhall eat thoſe things, for whom the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (or expiation <hi>was made.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conſecrate, and to ſanctifie them.</hi>] Their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and Sanctification began, by the Sacrifice for Sin; and was compleated by this now mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But a ſtranger ſhall not eat thereof.</hi>] None that are not of the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to whom alone this holy Food belonged. Nor were all his Domeſticks allowed to eat of it, though they might eat of other Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but only <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons: who being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Perſons, were to eat theſe things, which had a ſpecial holineſs in them, being part of the <hi>Sacrifice of Conſecration;</hi> and therefore appertained only to ſuch Perſons as had been conſecrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe they are holy.</hi>] Had a ſpecial holineſs, as I ſaid, in them; which made it fit only for ſuch Perſons to eat them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And if ought of the fleſh of the conſecrations, or of the bread remain unto the morning.</hi>] He and his Sons being not able to eat it all.</p>
               <pb n="588" facs="tcp:60246:298"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then thou ſhalt burn the remainder with fire.</hi>] This is a further argument, that there was a peculiar holineſs in this Sacrifice, of which only <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons might eat: for if this had been like to the fleſh of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> it might, according to the following Law, have been kept two days, before it was eaten, VII <hi>Lev.</hi> 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall not be eaten.</hi>] Upon the ſecond day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe it is holy.</hi>] Is of a more than ordinary San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity; being offered to make Men holy to God: and therefore the greateſt care was taken, it ſhould not be in danger to be in the leaſt corrupted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>And thus ſhalt thou do unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>and unto his Sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee.</hi>] This is the ſum of what I have to command thee, concerning the Conſecration of Aaron, and of his Sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seven days ſhalt thou conſecrate them.</hi>] They ſhall not be made compleat Prieſts, in leſs time than I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Which no doubt was to make them ſenſible of the weight of their Office.</p>
               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>And thou ſhalt offer every day a Bullock for a Sin-offering, for atonement.</hi>] Leſt he ſhould think that only the <hi>Ram of Conſecration</hi> ſhould be offered ſeven days together, he here expreſly directs, the <hi>Bullock</hi> for a Sin-offering ſhould be ſo often repeated. The reaſon of it follows, becauſe it was <hi>for atonement.</hi> Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the next words to ſignifie, that it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the atonement of the Prieſt, but of the Altar it ſelf, which was, by this Sacrifice, made fit for God's Service. And that's the reaſon perhaps, why he ſaith in the Plural Number, it was for <hi>atonements.</hi> So the Hebrew Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt cleanſe the Altar when thou hast made an atonement for it.</hi>] The Altar was not capable of any
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:60246:298"/>guilt; therefore this word <hi>atonement</hi> is here uſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, to ſignifie that by theſe repeated Sacrifices, it was ſet apart to be a place where Expiations ſhould be made. Or ſimply, this Expiation of the Altar was no more, but, of a common, making it a ſacred Place: or, as <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> underſtands it, it was purified by theſe Rites, from that deſilement it muſt be ſuppoſed to have contracted, by the hands of the Workmen that made it: for all Veſſels, in the ſenſe of the Law, were looked upon as made unclean, by the touch of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Perſon. And therefore perhaps the Altar was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo waſhed with Water, as the Prieſts were; which is here called its <hi>cleanſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt anoint it, to ſanctifie it.</hi>] To perfect its Sanctification or Separation from common uſe, it was anointed with the holy Oyl (mentioned in the next Chapter) as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were. For as by the Blood of the Bullock it was Expiated, ſo by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing it was Conſecrated: which is meant by <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>Seven days thou ſhalt make an atonement for the Altar, and ſanctifie it.</hi>] Many think that theſe were not diſtinct <hi>ſeven</hi> days from thoſe in which the Prieſts were expiated and conſecrated; as the Bullock for the Cleanſing of the Altar, was not a diſtinct Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock from that for the Prieſts: but the ſame Sacrifice ſerved for both. This Opinion I ſhall conſider in the concluſion of this Book (XL. 17, 18.) and now only obſerve, that thus not only the Prieſts among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but their Altars alſo were dedicated, by their <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robolia</hi> and <hi>Criobolia</hi> (which I mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 20.) for we find an ancient Inſcription, wherein one is ſaid to have ſet up <hi>PETRAM TA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ROBOLIATAM,</hi> an Altar conſecrated, by beſmearing it with the Blood of thoſe Sacrifices, as <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> interprets it, <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 69.</p>
               <pb n="590" facs="tcp:60246:299"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make an atonement for the Altar.</hi>] By the Blood of the Bullock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſanctifie it.</hi>] By anointing it with the holy Oyl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall be an Altar moſt holy.</hi>] The reaſon why it is ſo called, is given in the following words; becauſe it was not only thus ſeparated to an holy uſe, but made thoſe things to be holy which were offered upon it. Which they could not be till it was thus expiated and ſanctified. Therefore <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> expounds theſe words [<hi>an Altar most holy</hi>] it ſhall be <hi>fully and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſecrated,</hi> by obſerving all the Rites which are here preſcribed, for <hi>ſeven</hi> days together. Till the end of which no Sacrifice whatſoever was offered on this Altar (becauſe it was not cleanſed and ſanctified to make them holy and acceptable) but on the <hi>eighth</hi> day, when all was performed that was required on the preceding <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> days, fire came down from Heaven, and conſumed the Burnt-offering, VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 1, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever toucheth the Altar ſhall be holy.</hi>] Nothing was acceptable unto God, unleſs it was offered upon this Altar; which ſanctified every thing that was laid upon it, according to God's direction. Thus our Saviour ſeems to explain theſe words, XXIII <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>The Altar ſanctifieth the Gift.</hi> That was the name for all things preſented unto God, which were called <hi>Korban;</hi> being deſtined to be offered at his Altar.</p>
               <p>Ver. 38. <hi>Now this is that which thou ſhalt offer upon the Altar.</hi>] The principal uſe of the Altar was, That there might be a conſtant Sacrifice offered upon it, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of God's Sovereign Dominion over them. Which could not be done till it was expiated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: but that being finiſhed, <hi>Moſes</hi> directs here what ſhould be the firſt Sacrifice offered upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Lambs.</hi>] Theſe were to be a <hi>Burnt-offering;</hi>
                  <pb n="591" facs="tcp:60246:299"/>which was the moſt ancient of all other Sacrifices, being the ſame that <hi>Abel</hi> offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the first year.</hi>] See XII. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Day by day continually.</hi>] There were other occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sacrifices of various ſorts; but theſe were ſtated and ſo conſtant, that they were never intermitted. No, not upon Feſtivals, when other Sacrifices were added: as upon the Sabbath this Sacrifice was doubled, XXVIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 9, 10. and upon New-moons and other Feaſts, ſeveral other Sacrifices were appointed, as may be ſeen there, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and in the reſt of that Chapter. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by IX <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. that this daily Sacrifice was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (at leaſt for ſome time) in the Wilderneſs: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they began to wander to and fro, for <hi>Eight and thirty</hi> years, ſome think it was omitted. Which was the reaſon that God renewed this Charge in XXVIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 3, 4. See <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Menochius</hi> on that place.</p>
               <p>Ver. 39. <hi>The one Lamb thou ſhalt offer in the morning; and the other thou ſhalt offer at even.</hi>] At what time in the Morning and Even is not here plainly preſcribed: But the word in the Hebrew for the latter-being, <hi>between the Evenings,</hi> which was about <hi>three</hi> a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; the Morning Sacrifice alſo was offered between the Riſing of the Sun and Noon, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>nine</hi> a Clock in the Forenoon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 40. <hi>And with one Lamb a tenth deal of flour.</hi>] Moſt underſtand the <hi>tenth</hi> part of an <hi>Ephah,</hi> which was an <hi>Omer:</hi> concerning which ſee XVI. 36. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> afterward expreſly orders by God's command, XXVIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mingled with the fourth part of an hin of Oyl,</hi> &amp;c.] An <hi>Hin</hi> was the ſixth part of an <hi>Ephah;</hi> containing <hi>one</hi> Wine Gallon, <hi>two</hi> Pints and <hi>fifteen</hi> Inches (as Biſhop <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> computes it, in his Learned Treatiſe of <hi>Scripture Meaſures</hi>) So that the <hi>fourth</hi> part of it was a Quart,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:60246:300"/>and ſomething more than a quarter of a Pint.</p>
               <p>The principal thing here to be obſerved is, That this was ordained (as I noted upon the XXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter) to repreſent God's dwelling among them in the Sanctuary; where this daily Sacrifice was the conſtant Proviſion made for his Table (as the Altar is called) and Bread and wine a neceſſary attendant (as they are at all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) upon the Meat that was ſet before him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 41. <hi>And the other Lamb thou ſhalt offer at even, and ſhalt do thereunto according to the Meat-offering in the Morning, and according to the Drink-offering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>] The ſame Rites were to be obſerved in this, that were in the Morning Sacrifice, without any difference. For as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves, in his Preface to the Book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> the true Reaſon of theſe two Sacrifices was, That all Men, who live well, having two Meals a day, ſo many Sacrifices (which were his Meat) were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed for the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a ſweet ſavour.</hi>] See I <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.</p>

               <p>Ver. 42. <hi>This ſhall be a continual Burnt-offering through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Generations, at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] For there the Altar of Burnt-offerings ſtood, as we read XL. 6, 29. XVII <hi>Lev.</hi> 6, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Where I will meet you.</hi>] Their coming to Worſhip in that place, is called <hi>drawing nigh to God:</hi> accordingly he promiſes to vouchſafe his gracious Preſence with them. See XXV. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſpeak with thee.</hi>] More eſpecially, he promiſes to meet <hi>Moſes</hi> there upon occaſion; and to declare his Mind and Will to him, in ſuch Caſes wherein he ſhould conſult him.</p>

               <p>Ver. 43. <hi>And there I will meet with the Children of</hi> Iſrael.] That they might not think his meeting with them (before-mentioned) was only by revealing his Mind to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo to them, (as the laſt words of the fore-going Verſe might ſeem to intimate) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his meaning to be, that there he would grant Tokens of his ſpecial Love and Favour to them all, when they approached unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Tabernacle ſhall be ſanctified with my glory.</hi>] The glorious Preſence of God, which filled this Houſe, XL. 35. was that which ſanctified it, or made it an Holy Place. But ſome refer this not to the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which is juſt before mentioned, and the word <hi>Tabernacle</hi> not in the Text) and the truth is, they were made an holy People alſo, by this glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God among them, in the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Ver. 44. <hi>And I will ſanctifie,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt them to be ſanctified; or ſtill more compleatly ſanctifie them, by the appearance of the Divine Glory in the Tabernacle, IX <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] In the Hebrew the name is <hi>Ohel moed,</hi> which ſignifies exactly the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of Meeting:</hi> So called, not from the Peoples meeting there (as we ſeem to take it when we tranſlate it, <hi>Tabernacle of the Congregation</hi>) but from God's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there with them, which is mentioned juſt before; and in the next Chapter, XXX. 36. is expreſly called <hi>the Tabernacle of Meeting</hi> (as I think it ſhould be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated) <hi>where I will meet with thee.</hi> Which ſhows, that this was the reaſon of its name. See alſo XVII <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> Book II. <hi>p.</hi> 436.</p>
               <p>Now all the People could not come to attend upon the daily Sacrifice, which was offered for them, and ſo to meet with God here; and yet it was a Maxim among them, That <hi>no Man's Sacrifice was accepted, unleſs he was

                  <hi>Where I will meet with thee.</hi>] Though <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons might go no further than the Holy Place (except only once a year when <hi>Aaron</hi> alone went into the moſt Holy) to offer Incenſe, before the Mercy-ſeat: yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had the priviledge to conſult the Divine Majeſty, in the moſt Holy Place, where the Divine Glory ſhined, as theſe words, and XXV. 22. VII <hi>Numb. ult.</hi> ſeem to intimate. For ſince he was admitted into the Mount (as <hi>P. Cunaeas</hi> argues, in the place before-mentioned) to ſpeak with God face to face, for many days together; it is not unreaſonable to think that he was admitted to ſpeak with him, upon occaſion, in the moſt holy place in the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall burn thereon ſweet Incenſe.</hi>] He did it at firſt; but afterwards his Sons in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes performed this Service: as appears from I <hi>Luke</hi> 8, 9. where <hi>Zacharias,</hi> who was not High Prieſt, offered the Incenſe when it came to his turn, <hi>according to the cuſtom of the Priest's Office.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sweet Incenſe.</hi>] For it was a compound of ſeveral Spices, which were very fragrant, as appears by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of this Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>Every morning when he dreſſeth the Lamps.</hi>] At the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun the Prieſts went in to look after the Lamps which they had lighted in the Evening before. The dreſſing of them, as the Hebrews deſcribe it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in cleanſing the Snuff-diſhes, and ſnuffing thoſe
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:60246:303"/>Lamps they found burning, and ſupplying them with new Oyl; and in putting new Cotton (as we now ſpeak) and Oyl into thoſe that were gone out, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at ſome of the Lamps which ſtill continued burning.</p>

                  <hi>A perpetual Incenſe.</hi>] In the ſame ſenſe that the Morning and Evening Sacrifice is called a <hi>continual</hi> Burnt-offering, (XXIX. 38, 42.) this is called <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Incenſe, becauſe it was never intermitted twice a day. And one reaſon why it was thus continually burnt, was, becauſe of the vaſt number of Beaſts that were ſlain, and cut to pieces, and waſht and burnt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day at the Sanctuary: which would have made it ſmell like a Shambles (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſpeaks) if this ſweet Odour had not perfumed it, and the Garments of the Prieſts who there miniſtred. Whence, ſaith he, that Speech of our <hi>Rabbins, This ſweet Odour might be ſmelt as far as</hi> Jericho. Whereby the Reverence due to God's Houſe was preſerved; which would have been contemptible, if there had been an ill ſmell conſtantly in it, as he truly obſerves, <hi>More Nevoch.

<pb n="599" facs="tcp:60246:303"/>pour Drink-offering thereon.</hi>] There was another Altar appointed, without the Holy Place, for all theſe: which as they might not be offered any where elſe, ſo this Altar was appropriated for an Offering more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than all their Burnt-ſacrifices, or Meat and Drink-offerings. So <hi>Porphyry</hi> ſeems to have learnt from this place (for he was acquainted with theſe Books) <hi>It is most ſit to worſhip the Gods with Incenſe, both becauſe it is more grateful, and alſo more pure than an Hecatomb: for Blood doth not at all delight the Gods.</hi> Accordingly we find in XVI <hi>Numb.</hi> 46, 47. that the wrath of God was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, when it broke out in a Plague upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, meerly by offering Incenſe, whereby he is ſaid to <hi>make an atonement for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall make an atonement upon the horns of it once a year, with the blood of the Sin-offering of atonement.</hi>] Only once a year the Blood of that great Sin-offering, which was made for the general Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People, was to be put upon the Horns of this Altar; though no Sacrifice might be burnt upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Once in the year.</hi>] Upon the great Day of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the <hi>tenth</hi> day of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Month: when the High Prieſt was firſt to go with the Blood of the Sin-offering into the moſt Holy Place, and ſprinkle it before the Mercy-ſeat; and then come out into the Sanctuary, and there put the Blood upon the Horns of this Altar, and ſprinkle it upon it alſo with his Finger ſeven times, as we read XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall he make atonement upon it.</hi>] The <hi>Atonement</hi> mentioned ſo often in this Verſe, ſeems to relate to the Altar it ſelf (as it is explained XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.) which was hereby cleanſed from the Impurities, which it was ſuppoſed to have contracted by the Sins of thoſe who conſtantly officiated there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is most holy unto the LORD.</hi>] This may be meant of that Solemn Expiation, upon the Day of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement; which was the moſt holy Rite in all their Religion: for that Sacrifice is called by the peculiar Name of <hi>the Sin-offering of Atonement,</hi> or <hi>Expiation,</hi> XXIX <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. Or, it may be expounded of this Altar it ſelf; which by this was declared to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the moſt holy Service, in which none ſhould preſume to officiate but they who were thereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated. Which was the reaſon of the heavy Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah;</hi> for attempting that which belonged to the Prieſts only, as we read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVI. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying.</hi>] This is often repeated in this Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 17, 22, 34.) and in the next; to ſhow that God did not deliver all his Precepts to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but gave him ſome time to reſt, and then ſpake to him again.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>When thou takest the ſum of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after their number.</hi>] This was done twice by God's own order, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. and XXVI. From whence it doth not follow that it could not be done lawfully, without a ſpecial Command: for there might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Cauſes, why the Rulers of the People might think fit to order them to be numbred, eſpecially in time of War.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why this is here mentioned ſeems to be, becauſe, beſides the Offerings made voluntarily (XXV. 2.) every Man alſo paid half a Shekel towards the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tabernacle, and providing all the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it; for which directions had been given in the foregoing Chapters. This appears from XXXVIII. 25, 26.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall give every man a ranſom for his ſoul.</hi>] This was an homage, whereby they acknowledged they were God's redeemed ones; and whereby they alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Lives, which were in danger if they did not pay it.</p>

                  <hi>That there be no Plague among them,</hi> &amp;c.] Which God might have juſtly inflicted, if they had not made him this Acknowledgment, for increaſing and multiplying them according to his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>This ſhall they give, half a ſhekel.</hi>] A She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel wanted not much of our half Crown. See XXIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and Biſhop <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s Treatiſe of <hi>Scripture Weights and Meaſures, Chap.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <hi>After the ſhekel of the ſanctuary.</hi>] There the Standard was kept, by which ſuch money was to be examined: as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> commanded the Weights and Meaſures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all others were to be regulated, to be kept in the great Church of every City. For I ſee no reaſon to think, that there were two ſorts of <hi>Shekels</hi> among the Jews, one <hi>Sacred</hi> and the other Common; but much reaſon againſt it: for a <hi>Shekel of the Sanctuary,</hi> which is the Rule of the reſt, XXVII <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. was in value but <hi>twenty gerahs;</hi> which is the ſame with <hi>aguroth,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 36. and is by the LXX. tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">

That is, it was placed like our <hi>Fonts,</hi> which ſtand at the lower end of our Churches, towards the Door. So that the Prieſts coming into the Court, immediately went to the Laver and there waſhed, and then aſcended to the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt put water therein.</hi>] The Heathens were ſo Superſtitious, as to think there was a greater virtue in ſome Waters than in others for their luſtration: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Greeks</hi> (as <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> obſerves) would admit of no other Water, in ſome of their greateſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, but that from the Fountain <hi>Calliroho.</hi> But the Divine Inſtitution was more ſimple, requiring meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spring-water, for all manner of Purifications: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Water here mentioned was put into a Veſſel ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by a ſolemn Unction, XL. 11.</p>

See <hi>L'Empereur</hi> in the place above-named, where he treats at large of this; and of the Conveyance of Water into the Laver: which in the Tabernacle (at leaſt while they were in the Wilderneſs) was brought thither every day in other Veſſels, and put into it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Direction in the Concluſion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſe.</p>

               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Take thou alſo unto thee principal ſpices.</hi>] So we rightly tranſlate the Hebrew word <hi>Roſchim,</hi> which litterally ſignifies <hi>heads;</hi> but thence, the chief of any kind of thing: the <hi>Head</hi> being the principal or chief Member of the Body.</p>
               <p>As for the word <hi>Beſamin,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Spices,</hi> it ſeems to be a general Name, for all the following Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which are comprehended under it. See <hi>v.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of pure Myrrhe.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Mor,</hi> according to <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſignifies <hi>Musk;</hi> and <hi>David Kimchi</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends their Expoſition, who take it for a kind of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe: but the general Opinion of the Hebrews, as well as of later Writers, is, that it ſignifies <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which ſeems to be derived from the ancient word <hi>Mor.</hi> And that being the beſt which flows from the Shrub of it ſelf, <hi>Moſes</hi> is required to make uſe of ſuch <hi>Myrrhe.</hi> For the word <hi>Deror</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>pure,</hi> or not adulterated) properly ſignifies <hi>freely flowing</hi> or <hi>dropping</hi> Myrrhe: which was far better than that which came out from the Tree by Inciſion. The fragrancy of this is taken notice of by a great number of Authors; who alſo mention it as having a principal part in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the moſt coſtly Ointments, as <hi>Fort.

               <p>
                  <hi>Of ſweet Cinamon half ſo much.</hi>] There were two ſorts of <hi>Cinamon:</hi> one that doth not ſmell very much; another which was very Aromatick, and rarely to be
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:60246:308"/>found (<hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, in his time) but in the Cloſet of Kings. And therefore God commands <hi>Moſes</hi> here to take not meer <hi>Cinamon,</hi> but with the addition of <hi>Boſem,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>ſweet-ſcented.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And of ſweet Calamus two hundred and fifty ſhekels.</hi>] This Spice hath alſo the ſame addition of <hi>Boſem</hi> to it, becauſe there was a <hi>Calamus</hi> that was not ſweet-ſcented; and that which was they held very precious, being not of the growth of <hi>Judea,</hi> but coming from diſtant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So we read VI <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. <hi>Of ſweet Cane from a far Country:</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> intimates in XLIII. 24. that it was a Foreign Commodity of great value: and <hi>Salmaſius</hi> is poſitive, that there was no Aromatick Calamus grew out of <hi>India, Plin.

But <hi>Bochartus</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well obſerves that there was no Traffick, in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with <hi>India</hi> in the days of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and therefore they had it then from <hi>Arabia;</hi> where <hi>Dionyſius Perierge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> together with Frankincenſe and Myrrhe, mentions (in one and the ſame Verſe) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And of Caſſia five hundred ſhekels.</hi>] There is no mention of this Spice (which the Hebrews call <hi>Kidhah</hi>) but here and in XXVII <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. where it is joyned with <hi>Calamus,</hi> and reckoned among the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, which were brought to the Marts of <hi>Tyre.</hi> Therefore it doth not ſignifie that <hi>Caſſia,</hi> which is now uſed among purging Medicines; but another mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pliny</hi> together with <hi>Cinamon, L.</hi> XII. <hi>c.</hi> 19.

It was not thick, like thoſe Compoſitions which we now call Ointments, but thin as Oyl is; being nothing but Oyl, with an infuſion of theſe ſtrong Spices, which made it have a comfortable ſcent.

But the manner of making this Ointment, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> deſcribes it, was thus: The Spices were beaten ſeverally (he ſhould have excepted the <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which was liquid) and then they were mixt together, and macerated in pure Water, till all the virtue of them was extracted. Which being done, the Hin of Oyl was poured upon them, and all was boiled upon the fire, till the Water was evaporated, and the Oyl alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. See <hi>Guil.

               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever toucheth them ſhall be holy.</hi>] As the Gift was made holy by the Altar, upon which it was laid. See XXIX. 37.</p>

               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>This ſhall be an holy anointing Oyl unto me, throughout your Generations.</hi>] The Jews underſtand this, as if it were meant of this individual Oyl now made by <hi>Moſes;</hi> which laſted till the Captivity, or till the time of <hi>Joſiah.</hi> But this ſeems to be as fabulous, as that <hi>Joſiah</hi> hid it ſo, that it could never be found after his death. For there were ſo many things to be anointed with it at preſent, and in future times (all the High Prieſts being anointed, not with a drop or two, but with ſuch a plentiful effuſion of it, that it ran down to their Beards, nay, the Skirts of their Garment, CXXXIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> and their Kings alſo, when there was any doubt of their Title) that this Oyl could not laſt ſo long, much leſs retain its Scent for ſo many Generations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle, of which there was no need. For though there was near half an hundred weight of the Spices, yet there was but five or ſix quarts of Oyl; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ointment could not be more: the odours of theſe Spices being only extracted by infuſion, and the Subſtance left behind. And ſuch a quantity as this, one
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:60246:310"/>may well ſuppoſe was near ſpent, in the anointing of ſo many Things and Perſons, as are here mentioned: and therefore it was upon occaſion to be made again, as the Perfume was, which follows here <hi>v.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Yet it muſt be confeſſed that there hath been a very ancient Opinion among the Jews, That <hi>in the ſecond Temple there was no holy Oyl:</hi> for which one can ſee no reaſon; but that they did not think it lawful to make this Compoſition, and therefore conſecrated their High Prieſt, only by putting on their Robes. How they came to fancy it unlawful doth not appear; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this Unction after their return from their Captivity, ſeemed to foretel that there ſhould be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and better kind of Unction, which was by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; the variety of whoſe Gifts might perhaps be fore-ſhadowed by theſe ſeveral Spices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An holy anointing Oyl unto me.</hi>] There was no Rite or Ceremony ordained whereby this Oyl became <hi>holy;</hi> but it was conſecrated by this Divine Inſtitution, which appropriated it unto God alone in theſe words, <hi>unto me.</hi> Which ſeparated it to God's Uſes and Service; and made it unlawful for any Body to employ it to other purpoſes.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon mans fleſh ſhall it not be poured.</hi>] Here follow two Prohibitions, to breed in the People the greater Reverence to this holy Ointment. The firſt is this, that it ſhould not be poured <hi>on mans fleſh, i. e.</hi> on common Men, who were not Prieſts, or were not appointed by God to be anointed with it. It is well known that in the Eaſtern Countries (whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> alſo imitated) Men were wont to anoint their Heads and Faces, and that with very precious Ointments, eſpecially at their Feaſts, and when they would make a ſplendid Appearance: and therefore they are here forbidden to make uſe of this Oyl for ſuch U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <pb n="613" facs="tcp:60246:310"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall ye make any other like it, after the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it.</hi>] This is a ſecond Prohibition, not to make any Ointment of theſe Spices, for private and common uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is holy.</hi>] It is ſet apart for my uſe alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall be holy unto you.</hi>] And therefore you ſhall not imploy it to any other.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>Whoſoever compoundeth any like it, or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever putteth any of it upon a ſtranger,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, if any Man broke either of the foregoing Prohibitions, by making the like Compoſtion, or putting any of this upon one who was not a Prieſt, he was liable to be <hi>cut off from</hi> Iſrael. What that is, ſee XVII <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. The reaſon of theſe Prohibitions is manifeſt, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> excellently Diſcourſes, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 45. which was, That this ſweet Odour being ſmelt no where elſe, Men might be more in love with it in the Sanctuary: And that none by being anointed with the like, might fancy themſelves better than others, from whence great Diſſentions and Miſchiefs might have aroſe. The ſame may be ſaid concerning the Perfume, <hi>v.</hi> 37, 38.</p>
               <p>Kings indeed are ſaid to have been anointed with this very Oyl; at leaſt <hi>Solomon</hi> was, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> I. 39. (though we may doubt of <hi>David</hi> when he was anointed King of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 4.) which was, I ſuppoſe, by a ſpecial direction of the Prophets; that the People might look upon them as ſacred Perſons, and ſpecial Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God for their good. The Jews alſo will have it, that he whom they call <hi>the anointed of War,</hi> that is, ſay the Jews, the Prieſt mentioned XX <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. but I ſhould rather think, the General who commanded their Forces, in any ſudden danger, was anointed alſo with this Oyl, that he might be inſpired with Courage, when he fought as a ſacred Perſon. So that they interpret the firſt words of the foreging Verſe <hi>[upon mans fleſh
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:60246:311"/>ſhall it not be poured</hi>] in this ſenſe; <hi>None ſhall be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, but the High Priest, the anointed of War, and the Kings of the Houſe of</hi> David. For the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not anointed with it, but with ſimple Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, as they alſo tell us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>take unto thee ſweet Spices.</hi>] There are the ſame words here in the Hebrew, that we had before <hi>v.</hi> 23. ſave only that there he ſaith, <hi>Take to the Beſammim</hi> (with the addition of <hi>Roſch</hi> principal, or moſt excellent) and here take to the <hi>Samim,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>ſweet Spices.</hi> How theſe two differ, Interpreters of all ſorts extreamly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But they both ſeem to be general words, which contain the following Species under them; and <hi>Samim</hi> to ſignifie Spices of leſs value than <hi>Beſamim.</hi> The latter of which denotes ſuch Spices as were either liquid, or moſt proper to mix with Oyl, and other liquid things, to give them a fragrancy, as <hi>Fort. Scacchus</hi> thinks; who hath diſcuſſed theſe two words with great diligence, in his <hi>Elaeochriſm. Myroth. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stacte.</hi>] The Hebrew word ſignifies ſomething that drops, which ſome have taken for <hi>Balſom:</hi> but the LXX. tranſlate it as we do; and <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath ſhown that it is the liquid part of <hi>Myrrhe</hi> (not which ſlows of it ſelf) which drops from it, when it is preſſed out by Art: See <hi>Plin.

For ſome take it for the Hoof or Claw of an Animal (as <hi>Maimonides</hi>) others (as <hi>Jarchi</hi>) for the Root of a Plant, which is ſmooth and tranſparent as the Nail of a Man's Hand, which the Greeks call <hi>Onyx:</hi> But there are others, and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, who take it for the ſhell of a Fiſh, in the Fens of <hi>India,</hi> that are full of <hi>Spikenard;</hi> upon which this Fiſh feeding, it makes the very Shell odoriferous.

It appears by other places, that this Phraſe (to call him <hi>by name</hi>) gives <hi>Bazaleel</hi> the pre-eminence above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Artiſicers. See XXXIII. 12, 17. where he ſaith the ſame of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and XLV <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. where he ſaith it of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Bazaleel the ſon of</hi> Uri.] See 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 18, 19, 20. Though he was particularly choſen and ſitted for this Work; yet there was another joyned with him to be his Aſſiſtant, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Which two did not do all the Work with their own Hands (as appears from XXVIII. 3. where he ſpeaks of many Perſons endowed with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Skill) but they were the principal Artiſts, and the chief Directors and Overſeers of the Work. And therefore after the mention of <hi>Aholiab,</hi> v. 6. he ſpeaks alſo of others into whoſe hearts he had put Wiſdom, to do all that he commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſon of</hi> Hur, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Judah.] This <hi>Hur</hi> is thought by ſome to have been the Husband of <hi>Miriam,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Moſes.</hi> See XVII. 10. And then the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Abarbinel</hi> is not impertinent, that God did the more particularly declare his choice of <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> the more punctually remember it, to take away all Exceptions from the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> who might have been apt to think that <hi>Moſes</hi> had too much regard to his own Kindred, if he had appointed him to be the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of this Work, without the ſpecial Call of God unto it. For thus they might have cavilled (as ſome of them did afterward, in part) he makes <hi>himſelf</hi> King, and <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother High-Prieſt; and now delivers into the Hands of his <hi>Nephew</hi> all the Oblations and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections that have been made for the Tabernacle. For which there could be no colour, after God had ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, it was done by his ſpecial Order. He adds alſo (which is not ſo juſtifiable) that there was a ſtrife
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:60246:314"/>among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who ſhould undertake this Work; for which, though <hi>Moſes</hi> knew the fitneſs of <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> yet he durſt not mention him, for fear they ſhould think him partial; till God commanded him, ſaying, Do not regard what the People ſay, for thou, and they all, ſhall ſee, that he is choſen by <hi>me,</hi> and not by <hi>thee,</hi> unto this Work; for I will give him extraordinary Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

There were ſeveral, no doubt, who had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Genius to ſuch Arts as were neceſſary in this Work; but they could not, by their own Induſtry, have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Skill as God beſtowed on them; at leaſt not ſo ſoon, as to go immediately about the building of the Tabernacle, and all things belonging to it.</p>

On which he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> tell them, they muſt not do this Work, no more than any other: For the Tabernacle was built for the Service of God, which was principally perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this day. And he uſes a word of the Plural Number, not to ſignifie any other Sabbath but this; which recurring ſo often as once in ſeven days, he might well admoniſh them to keep his <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle plainly ſpeaks, II <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is a ſign between me and you.</hi>] This plainly ſhows he ſpeaks of the weekly Sabbath; the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which teſtified to all the World, what God they
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:60246:316"/>worſhipped: as all Nations ſignified, by their Rites and Ceremonies, what their Gods were to whom their Services were paid. Now the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtood in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation to God; as his Creatures, and as thoſe who were redeemed by him from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage: In both which regards the Sabbath was a Sign or a Token between him and them. For by obſerving one day in ſeven, after ſix days labour, they ſignified that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Creator of the World; who in ſix days made all things, and then reſted: and by obſerving ſuch a ſeventh day (See XVI. 5.) after ſix days labour, rather than any other, they ſignified they owned him to be their Deliverer from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery.

For it was peculiarly enjoyned to them, and to no other Nation; and was looked upon as a ſingular Benefit conferred on them above all People; as appears by the devout Acknowledgment <hi>Nehemiah</hi> makes of this, among the reſt of the Divine Favours to them, That <hi>he made known unto them his holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> IX. 14. and ſee XX <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11, 12.</p>

The ſenſe is this, in ſhort; He that violates a Negative Precept, as they call it, either doth it ſecretly, which is moſt frequent; or openly, which happens ſeldom: unleſs a Man be one of thoſe profligate Wretches whom we call Apoſtates. Now him that ſecretly brake the Sabbath, the Scripture threatens with cutting off, <hi>viz.</hi> by the hand of God, according to what is written here in this place. In like manner inceſtuous and unlawful Conjunctions are threatned, XVIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 29. becauſe they were wont to be committed ſecretly. But if any Man did any Work openly on the Sabbath, ſo that there were Witneſſes of it, he was to be ſtoned, according to what is ſaid XV <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. Though if he did it out of miſtake, either ſecretly or openly, he was only to bring a Sacrifice for his Errour: And if he offended againſt any of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Wiſe-men about the Sabbath, he was to be beaten. Or if there was no Court of Judgment in the place (as now, in their preſent Condition) then all ſuch Tranſgreſſors were left to God to puniſh them, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſort they were.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Six days may work be done, but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD.</hi>] So it is called alſo XXXV. 2. and XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. And

But the Hebrew words <hi>Schabbat Schab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baton (Sabbath of Rest)</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>Sabbath above all Sabbaths, i. e.</hi> the greateſt Sabbath; on which a <hi>rest</hi> was to be moſt punctually obſerved from all manner of Work: which the Jews, as <hi>de Dieu</hi> notes, call the <hi>weighty Sabbath;</hi> as if other days of reſt were but light in compariſon with this. According to that ſaying of <hi>R. Joſee, Great is Circumciſion, becauſe the weighty Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath gives place to it;</hi> that is, admits of this Work, though the Reſt on this Sabbath be ſo very great.</p>

<pb n="627" facs="tcp:60246:317"/>Delighted in the Contemplation of all his Works, which he ſaw were <hi>very good,</hi> I <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. The ſame <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> obſerves that the word <hi>jinnaphaſh</hi> (which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>was refreſhed</hi>) comes from <hi>nepheſh,</hi> which, among other things, ſignifies the intention of the Mind, and the Will: and therefore the ſenſe of this Phraſe is, <hi>All the Will of God was perfected and brought to a Concluſion; his whole good Pleaſure was abſolutely finiſhed on the ſeventh day,</hi> More Nevoch. P. I. c. 67.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And he gave unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>when he made an end of communing with him upon Mount</hi> Sinai.] When he diſmiſſed him, having ſaid all that is before related during his forty days ſtay with him in the Mount, he delivered unto him two Tables of Teſtimony, to carry down with him to the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Tables of Teſtimony.</hi>] Wherein God teſtified to them his Mind and Will, in the principal things which concerned their Duty. See XVI. 34.</p>

There is no ground to think that theſe Tables were made of ſome precious Stone (as the Author of the Book <hi>Coſri,</hi> and other Jews fancy) for the word <hi>Eben</hi> in the Hebrew ſimply ſignifies any ſort of Stone; and is wont to have ſome other joyned to it, when precious Stones are meant, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XII. 30. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> X. 2. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> III. 6.</p>

P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 66. In ſhort, this Phraſe ſignifies, that God employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any other Inſtrument in this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:60246:318"/>but it was done by his own powerful Operation. For all things that we do, being wrought by our hands and our fingers, theſe words are uſed to expreſs God's power. See XXXII. 16.</p>
               <p>This was a thing ſo notorious in ancient times, and ſo much believed by thoſe, who were not Jews, that many other Nations pretended to the like Divine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that they might gain the greater Authority to their Laws. Thus the <hi>Brachmans</hi> report in their Hiſtories, That the Book of their Law (which they call <hi>Caſter</hi>) was delivered by God to <hi>Bremavius,</hi> upon a Mount in a Cloud: and that God gave alſo another Book of Laws to <hi>Brammon,</hi> in the firſt Age of the World. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> ſay the ſame of thoſe of <hi>Zoroaſter;</hi> and the <hi>Getes</hi> of <hi>Xamolxis.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Brachmans</hi> have a <hi>Decalogue</hi> like this of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and accurate Interpretations of it, in which they ſay there is this Prophecy, That <hi>one day there ſhall be one Law alone throughout the World.</hi> This evidently ſhows how well the World was anciently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what a high eſteem they had of them.

<pb n="629" facs="tcp:60246:318"/>therefore is, that he ſtayed longer than they expected; ſo that they did not know what to think of it. And having as yet received no Directions about the Service of God, for which they were called out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (VII. 16. and other places) they thought it was time to deſire <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſet about it, in ſuch a way as other People ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Gods.</p>

And therefore <hi>Eben-Ezra</hi> judiciouſly interprets it, <hi>Some Corporeal Image in which God may reſide.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And faſhioned it with a graving tool.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>cheret</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>graving Tool</hi>) is uſed for a <hi>writing Pen,</hi> VIII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. and for a <hi>criſping Pin,</hi> which Women uſed about their Hair, III <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. And therefore Interpreters take it here for an Inſtrument of Engraving. And ſome think that <hi>Aaron</hi> made ſuch marks with it in this Calf, as there were in the Egyptian <hi>Apis:</hi> which was a Cow that had a Spot on her right ſide like a <hi>Creſcent</hi> (as ſome Writers ſay, though <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſay otherwiſe, and the marks are variouſly reported. See <hi>Pignorius</hi> in his <hi>Menſa Iſiaca, p.</hi> 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and a ſquare white ſpot in the forehead. But others think it more likely, that the Calf coming rough out of the Mould, <hi>Aaron</hi> only poliſhed it with a proper Tool. For though <hi>Apis</hi> was in great honour among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet it was a living Cow, and not the Image of one, which they had in ſuch Veneration. Therefore Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (in his <hi>Syntagma</hi> I. <hi>de Diis Syris, c.</hi> 4.) takes it to be more probable, that this golden Calf, or Ox, or Bullock (for ſo the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> differently calls it, CVI. 19, 20.) was made in imitation of that golden Ox that repreſented <hi>Oſiris;</hi> which was very famous among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Who had a mighty Veneration for the River <hi>Nile,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Hebrew <hi>Sichor</hi> (from whence came <hi>Siris</hi>) and for the <hi>Dog-ſtar</hi> (called <hi>Siris</hi> likewiſe) at whoſe riſing that River began to ſwell; and for the <hi>Sun</hi> (which was principally meant by this Name) to whom both the <hi>Bull</hi> at <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> and the <hi>Ox</hi> at <hi>Memphis</hi> were Conſecrated, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Saturnal, c.</hi> 21. But though all this be very ingenious, yet the truth of it may be well queſtioned, as I ſhall ſhow preſently; when I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this Tranſlation, <hi>faſhioned it with a graving Tool,</hi> is not ſo agreeable to what here follows, as another which the Hebrew words will as well bear.</p>
               <pb n="633" facs="tcp:60246:320"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>After he had made it a molten Calf.</hi>] The words in the Hebrew are, <hi>and he made it,</hi> &amp;c. we tranſlate them <hi>after,</hi> &amp;c. to make this agree with what goes before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Tranſlation, <hi>he faſhioned it with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tool:</hi> which may as litterally be tranſlated <hi>he bound them up in a bag.</hi> For we find the word <hi>jatzar,</hi> which we here tranſlate <hi>faſhioned,</hi> to have the ſignification alſo of <hi>binding</hi> or <hi>tying up:</hi> and <hi>cheret</hi> in the Plural Number to ſignifie <hi>a bag,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> V. 23. And thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves) deſcribes the making of Images, XLVI. 6. <hi>they laviſh Gold out of the Bag, and they make it a God.</hi> Which agrees with what is here ſaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> He received the Ear-rings, and put them in a Bag, and then having made a Mold, caſt them into it, and made a golden Calf. See <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A molten Calf.</hi>] So he calls it, becauſe it was no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a Calf, though the Head was like an Ox: and therefore, as I obſerved before, ſo called by the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</hi> What moved <hi>Aaron</hi> to repreſent God in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is hard to reſolve. Moſt think he imitated the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom he had long lived: which ſeems not to me at all likely, ſince he had ſeen the Judgment that God executed againſt all their Gods, XII. 12. yet ſo great a Man as <hi>J. Gerh. Voſſius</hi> hath taken a great deal of pains to prove, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was adored by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Serapis:</hi> and that his Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol was an Ox. This he hath laboured to ſupport by many ingenious Conjectures. But it is not likely, if he were thus publickly honoured as a God, that a King ſhould ariſe who <hi>knew not Joſeph; i. e.</hi> had no regard to him, I <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. and another ſucceed him, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ruin all his Kindred. The Worſhip of <hi>Serapis</hi> alſo was not ſo ancient; for <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith not a word of it, nor any Body elſe till the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great; and many Authors ſay it was brought
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:60246:321"/>into <hi>Egypt</hi> out of <hi>Pontus</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> See <hi>Bochartus</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 338. And though <hi>Apis</hi> was more ancient, yet not of ſuch antiquity as <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a very learned Perſon of our own (Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> now Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) hath ſhown in his Book of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Chap. VI. Part 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for <hi>Oſiris,</hi> both <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> ſay he was the ſame with <hi>Apis:</hi> which was not then known, as I have ſaid, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> no more than <hi>Typhus</hi> or <hi>Typhon,</hi> whom <hi>Philo</hi> thinks to be here intended; but was certainly a later Invention, and as <hi>Bochartus</hi> imagines, repreſented <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, though very much diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cuperus</hi> indeed hath made it probable (in his <hi>Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, p.</hi> 83, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that there was a <hi>Serapis</hi> worſhipped in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before that brought out of <hi>Pontus:</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no, I do not take it to be at all material, becauſe it is not likely that <hi>Aaron</hi> would make ſuch a Repreſentation of the Divinity, as was in uſe among them from whoſe Slavery God had lately deliver'd them. For how could he think the LORD, to whom he proclaimed a Feaſt, would be pleaſed to be repreſented by any of thoſe Idols, on whom, as I ſaid before, he had executed Judgment, at their departure out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt?</hi> Or what reaſon is there to think the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves could be inclined to think their God to be like any thing, which that People worſhipped, who abhorred the Sacrifices which the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Their Conjecture ſeems to me far more likely, who think that <hi>Aaron,</hi> in making this Calf, took his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern from ſome part of the SCHECHINAH which appeared to him and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (when they eat before God, XXIV. 10.) attended with the Angels: Some of which called <hi>Cherubim,</hi> they think appeared with the faces of Oxen. But as there is no mention in that place of <hi>Cherubims,</hi> nor of the Angels appearing in
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:60246:321"/>any ſhape whatſoever; and <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly ſaith, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw <hi>no manner of Similitude</hi> on the day when the LORD ſpake to them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. (and therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Elders, in all probability ſaw none afterward) ſo I think there is no evidence that the heavenly Miniſters at any time appeared in this ſhape, till the SCHECHINAH departed from the Temple, in the days of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> See XXV. 18, 20.</p>
               <p>After all this conſidered, <hi>Aaron</hi> ſeems to me to have choſen an <hi>Ox</hi> to be the Symbol of the Divine Preſence, in hope the People would never be ſo ſottiſh as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it; but only be put in mind by it of the Divine Power, which was hereby repreſented. For an <hi>Oxes</hi> head was anciently an Emblem of Strength, and Horns a common ſign of Kingly Power. So they were among the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (as <hi>Pignorius</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Menſa Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aca, p.</hi> 15. out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Praepar. Evang. L.</hi> I. <hi>cap. ult.</hi>) and among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> relates <hi>L.</hi> I.) and among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as appears by that famous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Genucius Cipus</hi> (in <hi>Val. Maximus L.</hi> V. <hi>c.</hi> 6.) who when he was <hi>Praetor</hi> had Horns come out of his Head on a ſudden, as he was going out of the City to the Wars: whereupon he was told, <hi>Regem eum fore, ſi in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbem revertiſſet,</hi> That he ſhould be a King, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the City. And ſomething like it is related by <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> concerning <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> at whoſe Birth a Cow brought forth a Calf with purple Horns, which they lookt upon as <hi>ſignum Imperij,</hi> a Token of Empire. Which made the ancient Fathers, perhaps, when they ſpake of this Calf, or Ox of <hi>Aarons,</hi> mention only its Head. For ſo doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> (<hi>L. ad verſus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos c.</hi> 1.) <hi>cum proceſſiſſet eis bubulum caput:</hi> and St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Lactantius,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and others: Not becauſe they thought <hi>Aaron</hi> made only the Head; but becauſe this was the principal part whereby God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, O</hi> Iſrael.] Or, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, IX. 18. <hi>This is thy God,</hi> &amp;c. the Image or Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Divine Majeſty: or as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> interprets it, <hi>His Divine Vertue reſideth in this golden Body.</hi> The Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Number is commonly uſed for the Singular, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when God is ſpoken of, as I obſerved before, XX <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.

               <p>
                  <hi>Which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt.] This ſhows they lookt upon this Ox, only as a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty LORD their God; for it being but newly made, they could not imagine they were brought by it from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, but by his Power, which perhaps they fancied now reſided in it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And when</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaw it, he built an Altar before it.</hi>] As at the Peoples requeſt he made it, ſo he ſeeing them receive it with ſuch applauſe, preſently Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it; by building an Altar, offering Sacrifices, and keeping a ſolemn Feaſt in its honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>made proclamation.</hi>] Cauſed it to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proclaimed throughout the Hoſt; that every one might have notice of the Solemnity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid, to morrow is a Feast.</hi>] Which was a part of Worſhip ordained by his Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the LORD.</hi>] Not to this <hi>Ox,</hi> but to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the World, whom they worſhipped in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

Some think indeed, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being gone, and, as they imagined, either burnt up or famiſhed, they deſired this Repreſentation of God to go before them and direct them, as a kind of <hi>Teraphim:</hi> but God allowed no ſuch viſible ſign to be made of his Preſence with them, which he knew would in a ſhort time have their Adoration.</p>

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And they roſe up early on the morrow.</hi>] The next day, which was the XVI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of our <hi>July,</hi> they kept their Feſtival. And to ſhow their Devotion, they began betime in the Morning, and ſeem not to have ſtaid for <hi>Aaron:</hi> but, as it follows, offered Sacrifices themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And offered Burnt-offerings.</hi>] Which always prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded others. See XVIII. 12. XXIV. 5. where I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that whole Burnt-offerings were intirely conſumed on the Altar being wholly Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And brought Peace-offerings.</hi>] This intimates that ſome Perſons received what they brought; and perhaps they were the <hi>young men</hi> mentioned XXIV. 5. where I noted alſo that of <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> the People that brought them had a ſhare, that they might Feaſt with God; and they invited their Friends likewiſe to Feaſt with them. There is no mention either here, or in the other places, of <hi>Sin-offerings:</hi> whereof the Prieſts had a part, but not the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the People ſat down to eat and to drink.</hi>] Upon the Sacrifices of <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> whereof the People, as I ſaid, had their part: and by partaking of it, had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Idol, to whom they were offered, as the Apoſtle ſhows, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 20, 21.

               <p>It may be fit here to note, That this Cuſtom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, and alſo of feaſting on the Sacrifice, in token of their Communion with him, to whom the Sacrifice was offered, was ſo very ancient, that it is not eaſie to believe the obſervation of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to be true, That God gave no Commandment about Sacrifices, till after this Sin of worſhipping the golden Calf. When ſeeing their proneneſs to offer ſuch Sacrifices, he thought ſit to ordain them himſelf, and direct them to their right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Much leſs is it true, that before this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:60246:323"/>we not find any where the Name of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> (as he ſpeaks <hi>Homil.</hi> XVII. upon <hi>Acts</hi> VII.) no not with the qualification of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who ſays (upon XV <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.) that there was no Law about Sacrifices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> till after they had committed Idolatry. For beſides that there is an order how to make an Altar, on which to Sacrifice their Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (XX. 24.) which ſuppoſes God's intention about them; and the building of an Altar and actual Sacrifice upon it, at the Sealing of the Covenant between God and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> XXIV. 4, 5, &amp;c. (which ſurely was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's command) there is an whole Chapter in this Book about Sacrifices at the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, before this ſin was committed, Chap. XXIX. and particular Directions given in the 38th and 39th Verſes of that Chapter, about the daily <hi>Burnt-offering.</hi> I omit what might be ſaid concerning the Oblation of Sacrifices from the beginning of the World, which it is hard to believe was without a Divine Inſtitution. St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words therefore are alſo too large, who ſaith, in his Commentaries upon XX <hi>Ezek.</hi> that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> received only the Decalogue before this Offence of the Calf: after which God gave them <hi>multiplices Legis Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonias,</hi> abundance of Legal Ceremonies. All that can be juſtly ſaid in this matter, is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> had not yet <hi>delivered</hi> to them the Commands before-mentioned, which God had <hi>given</hi> him; and that they had <hi>received</hi> but a few Commands about Sacrifices, till after this ſin: when the Precepts were multiplied, that they might upon all occaſions offer Sacrifice to God, and not to <hi>Daemons,</hi> as they were inclined to do. The daily Burnt-offerings were appointed before (as I ſaid) though not delivered to them; and ſo was the Sin-offering for the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and the Altar, XXIX. 36, &amp;c. But the Sin-offering for particular
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:60246:323"/>Perſons, and for the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the great variety of Sacrifices, with the manner of them, were not yet preſcribed; and perhaps were ordained upon this occaſion, to preſerve them from Idolatry; though not meerly for that, there being reſpect in them to the great Sacrifice of Chriſt, eſpecially in that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the Day of Expiation. But in general, it may be reaſonably thought that if they had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, they might have been left more at liberty, to do theſe things at pleaſure, according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and they might perhaps have been permitted to offer Sacrifices every where, as the Patriarchs did, though there is no certainty of ſuch Speculations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And roſe up to play.</hi>] So God commanded at their Feſtivities; and when they offered ſolemn Sacrifices to rejoyce before him, XII <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 7. XVI. 11. as <hi>David</hi> did before the Ark, after he had ſacrificed Oxen and Fatlings, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VI. 13, 14, 15, 16. Thus they now expreſſed their Joy, by Muſick, and Dancing, and Songs, and ſuch like tokens of Mirth, which was wont to be very great upon their Feaſts. See <hi>v.</hi> 18. There are thoſe, who think, that after they had eaten of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the Idol, and drunk liberally, they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fornication, after the manner of Heathen Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> expounds this Phraſe <hi>L. de Jejunio, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Intellige Scripturae verecundiam;</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture modeſtly expreſſes their lewd filthineſs. And ſo this very word which we tranſlate here <hi>play,</hi> is uſed by <hi>Potipher</hi>'s Wife, XXXIX <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. the Hebrew Servant came in, <hi>to mock me, i. e.</hi> to violate my Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did now, as they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they worſhipped <hi>Peor,</hi> XXV <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2. And the truth is, theſe Sacrifical Feaſts, were turned among the Gentiles into Drunkenneſs and Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are wont to be Companions: inſomuch that
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:60246:324"/>the ancient Greeks, even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> tells us, (<hi>L.</hi> II.) derived the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>after the Sacrifice;</hi> when they were wont to drink very largely. And it is alſo true, that nothing inticed Men to Idolatry, more than theſe filthy Pleaſures, which were a part of that Worſhip: yet I think it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the very Dedication of their Idol, when they pretended much Religion, fell into ſuch foul practices, which were not at firſt committed among the Heathen. Nor is there any ſignification of it in this ſtory; but only of their ſinging and dancing, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. (accompanied, it is likely, with Muſick) which <hi>Philo</hi> indeed calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, unſeemly Dances; but that was only, I ſuppoſe, becauſe they were in honour of a Calf.

                  <hi>Which thou hast brought out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>with great power and with a mighty hand.</hi>] This is one ground of hope, That God would not on a ſudden deſtroy what he had employed ſo much Power to preſerve.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Wherefore ſhould the</hi> Egyptians <hi>ſay, for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief did he bring them out.</hi>] This is another reaſon, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> might not be led into a misbelief, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their infidelity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſlay them in the Mountains.</hi>] There were many Mountains beſides <hi>Sinai</hi> (where they now were) in that Deſert into which God led them; and they were the moſt dangerous part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turn from thy fierce wrath,</hi> &amp;c.] Let theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations prevail for a Pardon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Remember</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to whom thou ſwarest by thine own ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the great Argument of all, the Promiſe made to their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:60246:326"/>fathers, who were his faithful Servants, and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe confirmed by an Oath (often repeated) which he hoped God would faithfully fulfil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will multiply your ſeed as the Stars of Heaven.</hi>] XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. XXII. 17. This part of the Promiſe he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; which made him hope he would fulfil the other part, which here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all this Land that I have ſpoken of will I give to your ſeed, and they ſhall inherit it for ever.</hi>] XII <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. XIII. 15. XV. 7. XXVIII. 13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</hi>] He did not change his Mind; for there was not a peremptory Decree, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence (as they ſpeak) pronounced againſt them: but only a ſignification of what they deſerved (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) which, unleſs it had been for the fore-named Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Interceſſion, he would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>turned.</hi>] From the Preſence of God, with whom he had been forty days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And came down from the Mount.</hi>] From the place where he was with God, to that where he left <hi>Joſhua,</hi> waiting for his return. See XXIV. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the two Tables of the Teſtimony were in his hand.</hi>] Which God promiſed to give him, and one would think had ready prepared for him before he went up into the Mount, XXIV. 12. and when he was coming down delivered into his hands, XXXI. <hi>ult.</hi> They are called <hi>Tables of Teſtimony,</hi> becauſe God declared and teſtified therein, what his Mind and Will was, as I have often noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tables were written on both their ſides.</hi>] Some fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that the Writing was both on the fore-part and the back part of them; that ſo the Ten Commandments might be read by thoſe who ſtood, either before or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:60246:326"/>when they were ſet up; being written (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Conceit) twice over. But they were not made to be ſet up, but to be repoſited in the Ark; and therefore the meaning is, they were written on both the Leaves (as I may call them) which were to be folded up, and ſhut like a Book, when they were laid in the Ark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the one ſide and on the other were they written.</hi>] On the right hand, and on the left. How many were written on the one, and how many on the other, is variouſly diſputed, but cannot certainly be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And the Tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the Tables.</hi>] The Tables were made, and planed by God himſelf; as well as the Letters written by him, XXXI. 18. and no Creature imployed in either Work; much leſs <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who ſeems to have found them ready prepared for him, when he came into the Mount, as I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from XXIV. 12.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And when</hi> Joſhua <hi>heard the noiſe of the people, as they ſhouted.</hi>] Being come to the foot of the Mount, they could eaſily hear the noiſe which the People made in the Feſtival.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>there is a noiſe of war in the Camp.</hi>] Knowing nothing of the occaſion, he took it for the noiſe which Soldiers make (called by the Hebrews <hi>teru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And he ſaid, it is not the voice of them that ſhout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome.</hi>] Being before inſtructed by God what: the People were a doing (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>Moſes</hi> could eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Miſtake; aſſuring him it was neither <hi>the cry of

               <p>
                  <hi>But the noiſe of thoſe that ſing do I hear.</hi>] Out of merriment in a Feſtival. For thus <hi>Apis</hi> was brought in ſolemn Pomp to <hi>Memphis,</hi> the Royal City; the Children going before in Proceſſion, and ſinging a Song of Praiſe to the Deity. Which was not the Pattern to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nor borrowed, perhaps, from them; but the common Practice of the World on ſuch occaſions, from ancient Times, as I obſerved before out of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) whoſe words are, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>That he ſaw the Calf and the dancing.</hi>] Which began early in the morning, and continued all day: for we may preſume it was towards the evening before <hi>Moſes</hi> got to the Camp; having ſpent a conſiderable part of the day in beſeeching God for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>anger waxed hot.</hi>] The ſight of their Madneſs, turned his Compaſſion he had for them (<hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, &amp;c.) into a kind of Rage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he cast the Tables out of his hands, and he brake them beneath the Mount.</hi>] He did not do it till now
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:60246:327"/>(though he knew their guilt, and no doubt was affected with it before <hi>he came night to the Camp, and ſaw the Calf and dancing</hi>) becauſe he would have the People ſee how he reſented their wickedneſs, and with what indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it filled him. And now he did it, no doubt, by the ſame Divine Impulſe, or Heroick Motion, which ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up to kill the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> See II. 12. For he is never blamed for this; and therefore did it by a Divine incitement: to ſhow the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> how unworthy they were to be eſpouſed to God (as ſome have expreſſed it) by theſe Inſtruments, or Deeds, which were moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tokens of God's love to them. To this effect <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel</hi> diſcourſes, <hi>Moſes did not leave the Tables in the Mount where they were delivered to him, when he heard how the People had revolted: but brought them along with him, that he might make all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſenſible what they had lost, by breaking them before their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And he took the Calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire.</hi>] Melted it down; ſo that though the Matter remained (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Gold) yet the form and external ſhape of the Calf was ſo deſtroyed, that it might be ſaid properly enough to be <hi>burnt.</hi> For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves) called that place where they melted their Metals <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ground it to powder.</hi>] Some have pretended to the knowledge of an Herb, which will diſſolve Gold, and reduce it to Aſhes: but they do not ſay what it is, or that it was to be found in that Wilderneſs. And if <hi>Moſes</hi> had known, and uſed this Secret, what need was there of his grinding it again, after it was diſſolved to Aſhes? It is moſt likely therefore that this was done with a file, whereby it was grated into duſt as ſmall as flour, which is ground in a Mill. With ſuch duſt, ſome powdred their own Hair, and the Mains of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Hierozoicon P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 34.)

               <p>
                  <hi>And made the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>drink of it.</hi>] He did not conſtrain them; but having no other water, they could not avoid, when they were thirſty, to drink with this mixture. Which <hi>Moſes</hi> threw into it, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who were guilty of Idolatry, as the Jews fancy, who ſay this was like the Water of Jealouſie, V <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. which made their Bellies ſwell, or their Beards, as ſome have ſince fabled, turn yellow (for it was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Apoſtacy, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 3.) but to make them ſenſible how vile a thing this Idol was; which was gone into their Draught, and mixed with their Dung and their Urine.

               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>what did this people unto thee?</hi>] It was not ſufficient that the Idol was deſtroyed, but he thought fit to call his Brother to an account, for his miſ-government in his abſence. Who makes a very weak defence, as all <hi>Commentators</hi> obſerve, to whom I refer the Reader. And ſhall only note, That the beſt Apology he could have made had been this (if it had been true) that he only repreſented God unto them, as he had repreſented himſelf to him and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> in the form of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, made part of the Train of the SCHECHINAH or Divine Majeſty.

               <p>
                  <hi>That thou hast brought ſo great a ſin upon them.</hi>] If they had made or built an Houſe for the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (ſaith <hi>Sepher Coſri</hi> in the place above-named) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fancies; that they might have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their Sacrifices there, and directed their Devotions thither, it would not have ſeemed to me ſo grievous a ſin: for at this day we make ſuch Houſes, and have a veneration for them, and promiſe our ſelves the Divine Benediction in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to make an Image, was directly againſt the Command of God; and to fancy that he would be preſent with that which he abhorred, very much aggravated the Crime.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaid, let not the anger of my Lord wax hot.</hi>] He beſeeches him in a very humble manner to hear him calmly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou knowest the people.</hi>] He had been long acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their rebellious and obſtinate Humour: which made them fall a murmuring as ſoon as ever they were delivered from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the Red-ſea, XV. 24. XVI. 2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they are ſet on miſchief.</hi>] The words in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>beráhu,</hi> are more emphatical, <hi>they are in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>in Idolatry:</hi> like that expreſſion in St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> V. 19. the whole World <hi>lyeth in wickedneſs.</hi> Or as we ſay in our Language, they were <hi>ſtark naught.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this Calf.</hi>] He ſpeaks as if he did not make the Calf, but the Gold being caſt into the fire, out it came in this form. Which made Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> think it more than probable,
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:60246:329"/>that there was ſome <hi>Magical</hi> or <hi>Daemoniacal</hi> skill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the ſudden moulting of this Idol, which very much increaſed the Peoples Superſtition to it. For what elſe, ſaith he, could <hi>Aaron</hi> mean by theſe words, <hi>I caſt it into the fire, and there came out this Calf,</hi> than that there was ſome ſecret inviſible operation whereby it was moulded into this form, in an inſtant: which raiſed, as I ſaid, the Peoples Devotion to it? Herein he follows ſome Jews, who go a great deal further, ſaying, That the Devil entred into it, and made it roar like a Bull, to ſtrike a greater awe into the People, as <hi>R. Juda</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pirke Elieſer, c.</hi> 45. And in <hi>Tanchuma</hi> they ſay, it not only roared, but danced alſo. Which ſeem to me to be Conceits invented for the Excuſe of <hi>Aaron;</hi> who is ſaid plainly enough, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to have <hi>made this molten Calf.</hi> Which he could not have done without deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and running the Gold into a Mould of this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>Here is no account at all given, what Judgment <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> made of this defence; but it appears by IX <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. that God was ſo angry with him, that he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, if <hi>Moſes</hi> had not interceded for him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched God to pardon his weakneſs in complying with a People ſet on Miſchief (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) For no doubt, in his own Mind he was againſt this Fact, as the <hi>Levites</hi> were, of whom he was the Chief.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And when</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaw that the people were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi>] Without the Divine Protection. For the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the LORD in the Cloud, it is likely departed, and went up from them; which we read deſcended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, XXXIII. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Aaron <hi>had made them naked,</hi> &amp;c.] Laid them open by this Sin, to the Scorn of all their Enemies; who ſhould hear of ſuch a ſhameful Revolt from their God.</p>

So it was in their Cities, in after times, which it is likely was derived from the uſage now: as now they did but follow the practices of their Fore-fathers. For in the days of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the City Gate was the place where all publick and private Buſineſs was tranſacted, XXIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 10, 18. which ſeems to have been the manner in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for at <hi>Schechem</hi> we find, as well as here at <hi>Hebron,</hi> when <hi>Hamor</hi> and his Son propoſed to make an Alliance with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they motioned it to the People at the Gate of the City, XXXIV <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And the LORD ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>face to face.</hi>] In a familiar manner, which did not affright or aſtoniſh him, by a dreadful appearance of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; which, in the ſight of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> lookt like devouring fire, XXIV. 17. but appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a milder and more chearful brightneſs. The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in XII <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. ſeems to relate only, to the Diſcourſe he had with <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was clear and plain, and by a Voice; not in Viſions and Dreams, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Reſemblances: and ſo it may be underſtood here, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> takes it, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 45. But <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks that theſe Expreſſions ſignifie, God treated with <hi>Moſes</hi> in his own Perſon, not by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour; juſt as one Friend converſes with another. And this is a common Notion among the Jews, that God did not ſpeak to <hi>Moſes</hi> by an Angel, but by himſelf: which they take to be the meaning of this Phraſe <hi>face to face.</hi> Which ſeem to me rather to import the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and evidence of that Divine Light, wherein God revealed himſelf to <hi>Moſes;</hi> whether it was by himſelf, or an Angel, it matters not. Yet the New Teſtament
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:60246:334"/>determines this queſtion, when it tells us, The Law it ſelf was <hi>given by Angels,</hi> in the hand of a Mediator. And accordingly the old Tradition was, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw things in a clear and bright Glaſs; but the reſt of the Prophets, in a Glaſs that was dim and cloudy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As a man ſpeaks to his friend.</hi>] This is added to ſhow, how differently God treated <hi>Moſes,</hi> from all other Men. For he is ſaid to have talked <hi>face to face</hi> with all the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> V. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. but it was out of the midſt of fire, which ſtruck a terrour into them: whereas he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the midſt of a glorious, but comfortable Light, which gave him high ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he turned again into the Camp.</hi>] After ſome time ſpent in Converſation with the Divine Majeſty, he went to comfort the People, it is likely, with hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Favour; of which they might have quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired, if he had ſtaid long from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But his ſervant</hi> Joſhua, <hi>a young man, departed not out of the Tabernacle.</hi>] It is hard to tell for what end <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſhould ſtay behind his Maſter; and it ſeems not decent that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould return alone without his Servant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. They that ſay he ſtayed to guard the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, have no foundation for it; and they have not much, who ſay, he ſtayed to give Judgment in ſmall: Cauſes, which needed not <hi>Moſes</hi> his Reſolution (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to XVIII. 26.) For we never read that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was a Judge, but a conſtant Attendant upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Perſon. And therefore the words may better be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, as they plainly run in the Hebrew, <hi>He turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Camp, and his ſervant</hi> Joſhua, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nun, <hi>a young man.</hi> At which there is a ſtop in the Hebrew (over the word <hi>Naar,</hi> young Man) to diſtinguiſh theſe from the following words; which are</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Departed not out of the Tabernacle.</hi>] That is, the LORD departed not from thence, but his Preſence
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:60246:335"/>remained there; and would not come into the Camp, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did. And this Interpretation is the more likely, becauſe the laſt words in the Hebrew are, <hi>out of the midst of the Tabernacle:</hi> which cannot refer to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> becauſe he did not go thither; but only <hi>Moſes,</hi> who converſed alone with the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Why <hi>Joſhua</hi> is called a <hi>young Man,</hi> when he was near <hi>ſixty</hi> years old, is not eaſie to reſolve. Perhaps it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>valiant Man;</hi> for ſo he was: or, he had waited on <hi>Moſes</hi> from his youth: or, as <hi>Maimonides,</hi> this is the Phraſe of the Hebrew Nation, who call all Men young, till they begin to decay; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> is called, when he was Thirty years old, XLII <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>More Nevoch P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</p>

It is likely, that after he was ſatisfied the People were very penitent, he returned to the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and there made this Addreſs unto the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for a perfect Reconciliation with his People.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt ſend with me.</hi>] Thou haſt only ſaid, thou wilt ſend an Angel before me; but I hope to obtain greater favour from thee, which thou haſt not yet declared to me. And I have no heart to proceed, if thou thy ſelf wilt not guide us in the Pillar of Cloud, as thou haſt done hitherto, and dwell among us, as thou haſt promiſed, in thy Sanctuary. This ſeems to be the ſenſe (if this Verſe be compared with the 15th) and not barely that he did not know what Angel he would ſend with him.</p>

But to <hi>know,</hi> is more than to <hi>call;</hi> ſignifying God's ſpecial Love and Kindneſs to <hi>Moſes</hi> above all Men, as the LXX. interpret it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou hast alſo found grace in my ſight.</hi>] God had often heard his Prayers for this People, as he hoped he would do now. For that was the effect of his being <hi>an acceptable perſon</hi> unto him; which is the proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Phraſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Now therefore I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy ſight.</hi>] If I ſtill continue in thy favour.</p>

The plain meaning of this Prayer is, That God himſelf would conduct him, and ſhow him the way wherein he ſhould lead his People, unto their reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> XXXII. 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy ſight.</hi>] That I may be fully aſſured of thy gracious acceptance of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And conſider that this Nation is thy people.</hi>] I do not beg this meerly upon my own account, but for thoſe who have been redeemed by thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have engaged themſelves to be thine by a Solemn Covenant (XXIV.) and now return unto thee by Repentance, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And he ſaid, My Preſence ſhall go with thee.</hi>]</p>
               <p>In the Hebrew, <hi>My face, i. e.</hi> I my ſelf, as the LXX. tranſlate it: <hi>My Majeſty,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee.</hi> He promiſes, that is, to continue with them, as he had done hitherto, and not meerly ſend an Angel to accompany them: but
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:60246:336"/>to lead and guide them himſelf, by the Pillar of the Cloud, and his glorious Preſence in the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will give thee rest.</hi>] Some think theſe words are particularly ſpoken to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſignifie that God would give him eaſe in this Point, and quiet his Spirit (which was now very ſolicitous about his Departure from them) by returning to them. But as the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words are a Promiſe, that he would take the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the People again; ſo is this, that he would not leave them till he had brought them to their reſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, If thy Preſence go not with us.</hi>] Some tranſlate the words, <hi>for he</hi> (i.e. <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>had ſaid unto him,</hi> i. e. to God, <hi>if thy Preſence,</hi> &amp;c. So that theſe words and the following are the reaſon of God's Anſwer to him, <hi>v.</hi> 14. And if they be not thus taken, one would have expected <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould rather have given God thanks for his gracious Promiſe, than further preſſed him to it. But the 17th Verſe doth not well agree with this; and therefore theſe words are to be looked on, only as part of what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to God, after his Promiſe that his <hi>Preſence ſhould go with him.</hi> Which he acknowledged to be the greater favour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe he had rather never ſtir from the place where they now were.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>So ſhall we be ſeparated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth.</hi>] This will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

               <p>
                  <hi>Shew me thy Glory.</hi>] In the Hebrew the word is <hi>hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> make me to <hi>ſee</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>apprehend with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> not with the bodily eye, <hi>More Nevoch.

For by <hi>Glory</hi> he there underſtands (<hi>cap.</hi> 54.) the Divine Eſſence, which he makes <hi>Moſes</hi> to be deſirous to apprehend; which is not likely, ſuch a Man as he ſhould think poſſible. For thus he explains himſelf in his Book <hi>de Fundamentis Legis, c.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 10.
<q>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know the truth of the Divine Eſſence, as one Man knows another, whoſe Face he beholds, and his Image is ſo engraven in his Mind, that he Exiſts there diſtinguiſhed from all other Men: So he begs that the Divine Eſſence might be diſtinct in his Mind, from all other Eſſences, till he knew the truth of it, as it is in
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:60246:337"/>it ſelf.</q> But he confeſſes in another place of that Book, (<hi>cap.</hi> 64.) That by the Glory of the LORD is many times underſtood a created Light or Splendor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God miraculouſly ſet forth his Majeſty, XXIV. 26. and other places. And I can ſee no reaſon, why it ſhould not ſo ſignifie here, and the meaning be, That he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee that glorious Preſence (or <hi>Face of God,</hi> as it is called) which he promiſed ſhould go with them; not vailed in a Cloud, but in its full Splendor and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. For hearing him ſpeak from the SCHECHINAH, he ſuppoſed, perhaps, that God appeared therein, in ſome viſible ſhape, which he deſired to be acquainted withal. To confirm this, it is obſervable that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his Anſwer to <hi>Moſes,</hi> calls this Glory <hi>his Face</hi> v. 20. as he had done <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. And thus <hi>R. Jehudah</hi> in the Book <hi>Coſri, Pars</hi> IV. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. (towards the latter end of it) ſeems to have underſtood it. See upon <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And he ſaid, I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee.</hi>] Which <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks ſignifies his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Moſes</hi> to underſtand the Nature of all Creatures, and how they are knit and united together, and after what manner they are governed, both in general and particular; becauſe when God had made all his Works, he ſaw that <hi>they were very good,</hi> I <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. But that Text is a very ſlender ground for ſuch an Interpretation. The LXX. ſeem to come nearer to the matter, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this paſſage, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I will paſs before thee with my Glory.</hi> That is, he promiſes to give him a Tranſient view of his Glory, while it paſſed by him, (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) though it could not be ſeen in its full Majeſty. And then the word <hi>tobhi</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>my goodneſs</hi>) muſt rather be rendred <hi>my beauty,</hi> it being the ſame with <hi>glory,</hi> only a ſofter word, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch a degree of its Splendor, as would not hurt
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:60246:337"/>him, but be delightful to him. And thus the word <hi>tobh</hi> is uſed in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter of this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> IX. 2. Or, if this be not the meaning, <hi>all his goodneſs</hi> muſt ſignifie his gracious Intentions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom, he aſſures him, he would fulfil all his Promiſes, which was ſufficient for him to know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I will proclaim the Name of the LORD before thee.</hi>] The LXX. ſeem to have underſtood this right, when they tranſlated it, <hi>I will call to thee by my Name</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>the LORD is before thee.</hi> That is, leſt, when I paſs by thee, thou ſhouldſt not obſerve it, I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh thee, by a Voice calling to thee, and telling thee, That now the LORD is preſenting himſelf to thee. And ſo we find he did XXXIV. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi>] This is the Subſtance of the words, which he tells him he would proclaim, after notice given of him of his coming to paſs by him. And their meaning is, that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe his Favours, according to his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as he did now to <hi>Moſes;</hi> unto whom he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed ſuch a Revelation of himſelf, as he did not make to others. For thus he explains it XXXIV. 6, 7. where he tells him, He would be very gracious, patient, and long-ſuffering unto ſome; but puniſh ſeverely the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of others.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And he ſaid, Thou canst not ſee my face.</hi>] But as for thy requeſt, that I would make thee ſee my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in its full Splendor, thou art not capable of it. I know none that hath explained this whole matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>R. Jehudah</hi> in <hi>Sepher Coſri, P.</hi> IV. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.
<q>For the Glory mentioned in Scripture, there is one of ſuch a nature, that the Eyes of the Prophets could ſuſtain it; another all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw (as the Cloud and
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:60246:338"/>the conſuming Fire) but another ſo pure and bright to ſuch an high degree, that no Prophet is able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it: but if he venture to look upon it, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is diſſolved, <hi>i. e.</hi> he dies.</q> Such was the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here ſpoken of, a Splendor ſo great and piercing that none could behold it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For there ſhall no man ſee me, and live.</hi>] Accordingly we find, when the SCHECHINAH, or Divine Glory, filled the Tabernacle, <hi>Moſes</hi> was not able to enter into it, XL. 35. that is, he could not, with ſafety to his life, look upon it. And ſo it was after the Temple of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman</hi> was built and conſecrated by Solemn Prayer to God, <hi>The Glory of the LORD filled the Houſe, and the Prieſts could not enter into the Houſe, becauſe the Glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's Houſe,</hi> 2 Chron. VII. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>From this Speech to <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is likely that Men in future times, imagined they ſhould die immediately, when they ſaw only an Angel appear in ſuch a high glittering manner that it amazed them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And the LORD ſaid, Behold there is a place by me.</hi>] It doth not plainly appear by the ſtory, from whence God now ſpake to <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Mount, where he had long converſed with him. Or, if it was from the Tabernacle (where his Glory appeared <hi>v.</hi> 9. and continued <hi>v.</hi> 11.) that was not far from the Mount; where he tells him, he would make his Glory paſs before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt ſtand upon a Rock.</hi>] It is probable, This was the Rock in <hi>Horeb,</hi> where the LORD had formerly appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> XVII. 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that while my Glory paſſeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the Rock.</hi>] Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was in one of the Clefts which was made in the Rock, when God brought Water out of it, LXXVIII

               <p>
                  <hi>And I will cover thee with my hand,</hi> &amp;c.] That he might not be hurt by the ſplendour of that Glory, as it paſſed by the Cleft. This doth not certainly ſignifie, that the Glory of the LORD appeared in an Human ſhape: for Hands are aſcribed to God (in accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us) when nothing is meant but this inviſible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: which now, perhaps, caſt a Cloud about him, that he might not be ſtruck dead by the inconceivable bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and force of thoſe Rays, which came from the Face of the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And I will take away mine hand.</hi>] As ſoon as the Face (as it is called <hi>v.</hi> 20.) of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was gone by him (which it was impoſſible for him to behold, and live) he promiſes to remove that Cloud which covered him: ſo that he ſhould look upon the hinder Parts of his Glory, though not upon the Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt ſee my back parts.</hi>] In which the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Divine Majeſty ſhone, in a lower degree of Light; which was not ſo piercing, as to put out the Eyes, and take away the Life of the Beholders: And yet there was ſuch a reſplendent Brightneſs in it, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face ſhone when he came down from the ſight of it, XXXIV. 29. For that luſtre in his Countenance, is to be aſcribed, in all probability, to that ſight which he had of the Divine Majeſty at that time. Some little Particles of Light remaining upon his Face, and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it (if I may ſo ſpeak) from that exceeding great Splendour which ſhone upon him, and paſſed before him, as he lay in the hollow place of the Rock.</p>

                  <hi>v.</hi> 20. There are many other Interpretations of this Verſe, as well as of the 18th and 19th. <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Book <hi>de Fundam Legis, c.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 11. takes it thus:
<q>God revealed that to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which no Man, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after him, ever knew: he making him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſomething of his very Eſſence, whereby God was ſeparated in his Mind, from all other Beings; as a Man diſcerns another Man, when he ſees his back parts, and by his Mind diſcerns his Proportions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from all other Men.</q> But in his <hi>More Nevoch.

               <p>
                  <hi>And that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi>] Theſe words, according to <hi>Maimonides,</hi> belong ſtill to the loving kindneſs of God, as all the foregoing do; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:60246:341"/>that when he doth puniſh, he will not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy and make deſolate. For ſo the Hebrew words, <hi>Nakkeh lo Jenakkeh,</hi> he thinks are to be litterally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>in extirpating, he will not extirpate;</hi> as the word <hi>Nakah</hi> he obſerves is uſed, III <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26. <hi>She ſhall ſit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate on the Earth.</hi> And to the ſame ſenſe theſe words are expounded by many Modern Interpreters; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Lud. de Dieu, When he empties, he will not empty;</hi> or <hi>make quite deſolate.</hi> For the Maxim of the Hebrew is (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> there obſerves, <hi>More Nevoch P.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 54.) that, <hi>the property of Goodneſs far excels that of Severity.</hi> For here being <hi>thirteen</hi> Properties of God mentioned (I can find but <hi>ten,</hi> beſides the Name of LORD) there is but one of them that belongs to the latter (<hi>viz.</hi> that which follows) all the reſt belong to the former. And indeed, we find that <hi>Moſes</hi> urges theſe very words, among other, why God ſhould not deſtroy the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> as one Man, XIV <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. which had been very improper, if God would, <hi>by no means clear the guilty.</hi>

                  <hi>Viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</hi>] This is meant, ſaith the ſame <hi>Maimonides,</hi> only of the Sin of Idolatry; unto which God threatens, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, this Puniſhment to the third and fourth Generation, upon <hi>thoſe that hate him.</hi> For no Man is called a hater of God, but only an Idolater; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we read XII <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. <hi>Every abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the LORD hateth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the third and fourth Generation.</hi>] He mentions, ſaith the ſame Author, none Beyond theſe; becauſe the utmoſt that any Man can live to ſee of his Seed, is the <hi>fourth</hi> Generation. And therefore when an Idolatrous City was deſtroyed, the old Idolater, with Children, Grand-children, and Great-grand-children, were all cut off; according to the Precept XIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. <hi>Deſtroy it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and all that is therein.</hi>

               <p>The ſenſe of the whole ſeems to be, That this is the Glory of the Divine Majeſty, that he hath a Soveraign Dominion over all, becauſe he is the Fountain of Being, the Original of all things; moſt powerful to do what he pleaſes; and ſo merciful that he delights to beſtow his Benefits unasked; and ſo gracious, as to continue them to the unthankful: bearing long with them, when they provoke him; multiplying Favours on thoſe who have no Deſerts; and faithfully performing his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, though never ſo great; doing good unto a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Generations of thoſe who adhere faithfully to him, and do not apoſtatize from him: for he pardons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Offences, of all ſorts, that are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Laws; and when the Provocations are ſo great, that they are fit to be puniſhed, he proceeds not to the utmoſt Extremity, till there be no Remedy; then he puniſhes Idolaters terribly, to the third and fourth Generation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>made haſte, and bowed his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Earth, and worſhipped.</hi>] Being tranſported with Joy at ſo glorious a ſight, and ſuch gracious words, he immediately worſhipped God with the humbleſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, acknowledging his great Condeſcention to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If now I have found grace in thy ſight, O Lord.</hi>] He doth not doubt of it; but the meaning rather is, <hi>Since I have found grace,</hi> &amp;c. as appears from what he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him XXXIII 17, 18, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us.</hi>] Upon the mention of the laſt Property of the Divine Majeſty [<hi>viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have been afraid he might be provoked to proceed to ſuch Severity with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:60246:342"/>lately apoſtatized from him. And again beſeeches him, he would be ſo gracious, though they ſhould again of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, as to continue his Preſence among them, which he had threatned to withdraw XXXIII. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is a ſtiff-necked people.</hi>] If we adhere to this Tranſlation, the meaning is, they needed ſuch a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by whoſe Authority and Preſence they might be kept in awe, and cured of their perverſneſs. But the Particle <hi>ki,</hi> which we here tranſlate <hi>for,</hi> often ſignifies <hi>though;</hi> and may be very fitly ſo rendred here: and then the meaning is, Though they be very Refractory, (XXXII. 9.) yet do not forſake them, and leave them to themſelves; but ſtill conduct them, as thou haſt done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And pardon our iniquity and our ſin, and take us for their inheritance.</hi>] Since thou art ſo ready to forgive (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) do not cut us off for our late Offences; but ſtill continue to own us for thy peculiar People. This <hi>Moſes</hi> had begg'd of God before, and obtained a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of it, XXXIII. 16, 17. (and ſee XIX. 5.) and now he beſeeches him, out of his Goodneſs which he had proclaimed, to confirm that Promiſe, and not to revoke it upon every new Provocation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, behold, I make a Covenant.</hi>] Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God verified the truth of what he had proclaimed: being ſo <hi>merciful and gracious,</hi> as not only to confirm his Promiſe, but to turn it into a Covenant, like that at the giving of his Laws from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> XXIV. 3, 7, &amp;c. which he renews with them in the next Verſe. Where he engages to drive out the Inhabitants of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> before them; and then requires them to take care not to imitate their Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before all thy people will I do marvels, ſuch as have not been done in all the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſeems to relate to all the wonderful Works he intended to do, in their
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:60246:343"/>Introduction into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by making the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> retire, and the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fall down; with the reſt that followed, till they got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their Inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee</hi>] Such as ſhall declare the Almighty Power of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and ſtrike a Terrour into all thoſe that oppoſe him, but demonſtrate (in an aſtoniſhing manner) his Fidelity to his People. For all this is ſaid to confirm their belief of the Covenant he ſaid he would make with them in the beginning of the Verſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Obſerve thou that which I command thee this day.</hi>] Doubt not of what I ſay; but only mark, and take care to do all that I now enjoyn thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, I drive out before thee the</hi> Amorite, <hi>and the</hi> Canaanite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] To encourage them ſo to do, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes what he intended to do for them; which he put at the Concluſion of his Covenant, when he firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it, XXIII. 23, 28. but here puts it in the front of it, that they might be the more ſenſible of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of thoſe Commands to which he expected O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf.</hi>] He now renewing that Covenant with them, which they had broken by the worſhipping the golden Calf, repeats the principal Precepts which concerned his Worſhip and Service (which had been delivered to them before) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them to the obſervance of them, by the addition of a very gracious Promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt thou make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land whether thou goeſt.</hi>] Nothing could be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than this, that they ſhould not enter into Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with thoſe Nations, whom he commanded them to expel, for their abominable Wickedneſs; unleſs they would renounce their Idolatry, and come under their

               <p>Some of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> reſtrain'd this Precept only to the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> where they were bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy all Things belonging to the Religion of thoſe Idolatrous People, in whoſe place they were planted, that they might not be infected with their Impiety.

                  <hi>For the LORD whoſe name is Jealous.</hi>] So he calls himſelf, XX. 5. and gave himſelf this peculiar Name, becauſe he could not bear any other God to be Rival with him, after the manner of the Gentiles. Whoſe Gods ſuffered a number of other Gods, to ſhare in the Worſhip that was given to them, by offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and burning Incenſe, and bowing down to them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Lest thou make a Covenant with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land.</hi>] That is, a Covenant of <hi>Marriage</hi> (for Covenants in general were forbidden before <hi>v.</hi> 12.) which he commands them not to contract with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Canaan:</hi> no, nor with any Idolaters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. For though ſome of the Jews would reſtrain this to the VII Nations only; yet the generality of them reſolve it is meant of all other Idolatrous People. And there is an illuſtrious Argument of it, in the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth</hi> Chapters of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and in XIII <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 25. This they will have to have been as old as the Law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; which they gather from XXXIV <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. and it held throughout all following Ages. Inſomuch that
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:60246:344"/>

As for ſuch as turned from Idolatry, it was always lawful to marry them; but they were ſo far from having to do with others, that the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> held it as unlawful to lye with a Gentile Woman, as with a Woman in her Uncleanneſs.

               <p>
                  <hi>And thou eat of his Sacrifice.</hi>] By this we ſee how ancient and univerſal the Cuſtom was of Feaſting upon Sacrifices: which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> truly calls <hi>Epulae Faederales,</hi> Faederal Feaſts (upon 1 <hi>Malachi</hi> II. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.) For the Meat was God's, being ſet upon his Table; of which he inviting the Offerers to partake, they were his Gueſts; whom he entertained at his Table, in token of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Friendſhip with him. And therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eat of the Sacrifices offered to other Gods, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves to be their Worſhippers and Servants. Which made the Jews ſo cautious in this matter, that they would not ſo much as drink the Wine, or the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or uſe the Salt of an Idolater, not knowing but it
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:60246:345"/>might have been ſet before an Idol. So <hi>R. Levi Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolonita</hi> in the Explication of the CXII. <hi>Praecept.</hi> This explains that Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> X. 20.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And thou take of their Daughters unto thy Sons,</hi> &amp;c.] If they themſelves married Idolaters, there was the greater danger they might be content, to let their Sons and Daughters marry with them; eſpecially if they were Rich or Beautiful: and ſo the whole Family be undone.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Write thou theſe words.</hi>] From <hi>v.</hi> 11. to this place: juſt as he did thoſe words contained in the XXI, XXII, XXIII Chapters of this Book (See XXIV. 4.) out of which theſe words are extracted, as the chief things reſpecting the Worſhip of God; which he requires him to write in a Book by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For after the tenor of theſe words have I made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thee, and with</hi> Iſrael.] See XXIV. 7. Where the Covenant, containing theſe words and many other, was Sealed with the Blood of a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The Jews are ſo blind as to found their Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this place, and upon one ſmall word <hi>(Pi)</hi> which ſignifies indeed <hi>mouth;</hi> but withal is an exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particle, denoting the manner and value of any thing, as appears from XLIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.

Which was partly to make a new trial, how they would behave themſelves in his Abſence; and partly to give the greater Authority to the Laws he brought them from God, which he renewed, as we read in the end of this Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And did neither eat bread, nor drink water.</hi>] But was ſupported by Influences from the Almighty, who kept up his Spirits in their juſt height, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Recruits of Meat and Drink. Which, when they give us Refreſhment, likewiſe make us drowſie; See XXIV. 18. To which add what <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith in the place now named, That the Joy wherewith he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, made him not think of eating and drinking; for his intellectual Faculties were ſo ſtrong, that all Corporal Deſires ceaſed.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me very probable, That during this time, he ſaw again the Model of the Tabernacle, and all its Furniture, with every thing elſe he was ordered to make when he went firſt into the Mount, from the beginning of the XXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end of the XXX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter; which are briefly ſummed up XXXI. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. He ſeems alſo to have ſpent much of this time in Prayer to God for the People, That he would reſtore them intirely to his Favour, and bring them to their Inheritance, IX <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, 19, 25, 26. X. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he wrote upon the Tables the words of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the LORD wrote (as he ſaid he
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:60246:347"/>would <hi>v.</hi> 1.) not <hi>Moſes:</hi> who wrote the foregoing words in a Book; but not theſe, which were written by the Finger of God in the Tables of Stone. So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> tells us expreſly, X <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>Jacobus Capellus,</hi> and others following the Hebrew Doctors, imagine that <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>three</hi> times with God in the Mount, for the ſpace of XL. days; and that this was the laſt time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and the firſt they place another, which they fancy is mentioned XXXII. 30, 31. compared with IX <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, &amp;c.

               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And it came to paſs when</hi> Moſes <hi>came down from Mount</hi> Sinai.] Which was upon the XXV. of our <hi>August,</hi> according to the former Computation, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>With the two Tables of Teſtimony in</hi> Moſes <hi>hand, when he came down from the Mount.</hi>] So he came down at the firſt, XXXII. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Moſes <hi>wist not that the skin of his face ſhone.</hi>] There was a radient Splendour in his Countenance; which is the import of the Hebrew <hi>Karan,</hi> which the Vulgar tranſlates <hi>horned.</hi> Not imagining that <hi>Moſes</hi> had Horns, but Rays of Light, which imitated Horns. And therefore the Hebrew word <hi>Karnaim</hi> ſignifies both; and <hi>R. Solomon Jarchi</hi> upon this place calls theſe Rays on <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face, <hi>Horns of Magnificence,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 292. It is not improbable that the Hair of his Head was inter-ſperſed with Light, as well as that Rays came from his Face; which perſtringed the Eyes of Beholders. And Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had done more reaſonably, if inſtead of <hi>Horns</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moſes</hi> his Forehead, they had repreſented him with a <hi>Glory</hi> crowning his Head, as the Saints are uſually pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Which perhaps came from
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:60246:347"/>the ancient Cuſtom among the Heathen, who thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their Gods, as <hi>Tho. Bartholinus</hi> obſerves (<hi>de Morbis Biblicis cap.</hi> 5.) out of <hi>Lucian de Dea Syria,</hi> where he ſaith ſhe did <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>While he talked with him.</hi>] While he converſed ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliarly with the Divine Majeſty, and both ſaw his Glory and heard him proclaim his Name, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. At his firſt being in the Mount, there was no ſuch Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs left upon his Countenance; for he did not ſee the Divine Majeſty in ſo great a Splendour as he did now; when the LORD, upon his Petition, vouchſafed him ſuch a ſight of his Glory, as he could bear, XXXIII. 18, 23. Which was ſo exceeding piercing, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the very Skin of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Face, and made it lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. Of which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſeem to have been ſenſible, till ſome time after he came down from the Mount (when <hi>Aaron,</hi> as well as others, were afraid to come nigh him) having his Thoughts wholly poſſeſſed with the far more tranſcendent Glory of the Divine Majeſty, of which he had a Glimpſe.</p>
               <p>From this familiar Conference which <hi>Moſes</hi> had with God, it is likely the Heathen took occaſion to invent the like Stories of their <hi>Zamolxis,</hi> who pretended to receive his Laws from <hi>Veſta;</hi> and <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who ſaid they received theirs from <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo:</hi> with ſeveral others mentioned by <hi>Diodorus Siculus L.</hi> I. who then adds <hi>Moſes</hi> had his from the God <hi>Jao;</hi> ſo they pronounced the Name <hi>Jehovah.</hi> But they had no
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:60246:348"/>ſuch Teſtimony as this of their Communication with the Divine Majeſty; much leſs were their Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſuch Miracles, as laſted for the ſpace of XL. years under the Conduct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſight of all People.</p>

By <hi>all the Children of Iſrael</hi> in this Verſe, ſeems to be meant <hi>all the Rulers of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> mentioned in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they were afraid to come nigh him.</hi>] The Light which ſhone from his Countenance was ſo great, that it dazled the Eyes of Beholders; even of <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf: who did not know whether it would be ſafe to approach him. This was an illuſtrious Teſtimony, that he had been with God, <hi>who dwells,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>in light inacceſſible.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="689" facs="tcp:60246:348"/>Tribes ſummoned, that he might deliver to them all that which he had received from God. See XXXV. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he gave them in Commandment all that the LORD had ſpoken with him in Mount</hi> Sinai.] All the Orders he had given about the Building of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the reſt contained in the XXV, XXVI Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thoſe that follow to the XXXII. For at his firſt coming from the Mount, finding them in an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from God, he ſaid nothing to them about theſe matters: but, in abhorrence of their foul Idolatry, broke the Tables of Teſtimony, which God had given him to deliver to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>And till</hi> Moſes <hi>had done ſpeaking with them, he put a vail on his face.</hi>] This ſeems to belong as well to <hi>v.</hi> 31. as to the 32d, and accordingly I have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Though there are thoſe who think, he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Rulers to approach without a Vail: but put it on, when he ſpake to the People, who were leſs able to bear it. But there ſeems to be the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for both; <hi>Aaron</hi> being no leſs afraid than any of them. And the Majeſty of his Countenance appeared ſufficiently, even when it was vailed: for the brightneſs was not quite obſcured, though very much ſhaded by it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>But when</hi> Moſes <hi>went in before the LORD to ſpeak with him, he took the vail off, till he came out.</hi>] He went into the Tabernacle, where he ſpake with him face to face, as a Man ſpeaks to his Friend, XXXIII. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he came out, and ſpake unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that which he was commanded.</hi>] This ſeems to relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the frequent occaſions <hi>Moſes</hi> had to go and conſult with God in difficult Caſes; whoſe Mind he declared to them when he had received it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaw the face of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>that the skin of</hi> Moſes <hi>face ſhone,</hi> &amp;c.] Some great
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:60246:349"/>Men have thought that the brightneſs continued on <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face till his death; ſo that he ſpake to them with a Vail on his Face, from this time as long as he lived. Of which we cannot be certain; though thus much is evident from this and the foregoing Verſe, that the Splendour of his Countenance did remain for ſome time after he came down from God's Preſence in the Mount. During which, as oft as he went in to ſpeak with God he took off his Vail, and when he came out to ſpeak with them, he put it on; <hi>until he went in to ſpeak with God again,</hi> as this Verſe concludes. How long it was before it vaniſhed, none can reſolve. Perhaps not till he had ſet up the Tabernacle, and conſecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and delivered all the Laws he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about the Service of God, which are recorded in the Book of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> That is, all the time they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> from whence they removed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than half a year after this, X <hi>Numb.</hi> 11, 12.</p>

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>THen wrought</hi> Bezaleel <hi>and</hi> Aholiab, <hi>and every wiſe-hearted man,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe is only a general Account of what follows more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, concerning the Execution of that which God had commanded, and for the effecting of which the People had liberally contributed.

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:60246:354"/>which the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>had brought for the work of the Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c.] Into the hands of all theſe Artiſts, <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the Offerings that had been made; and directed them what to do with them.</p>

                  <hi>And they brought yet unto him Free-offerings every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>] The hearts of the People were ſo enlarged, that every day they brought new Contributions unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> who ſent them (as appears by the next Verſe) to the Workmen, as ſoon as he received them.</p>

In which Chapter moſt of the things here mentioned, are explained; and there needs little to be added here.</p>
               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>And</hi> Bezaleel <hi>made the Ark of Shittim-wood,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Abarbinel</hi> fancies, that though other things were made by inferiour Artificers, whom <hi>Bezaleel</hi> directed; yet the Ark, becauſe of its dignity and preheminence, above all other things was made by him, without the help of any other. And ſo <hi>Rambam</hi> alſo; from whence the Jews commonly called it (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> obſerves) the <hi>Ark of Bezaleel.</hi> But this hath no good foundation; for he is ſaid to have made alſo every thing elſe in the Tabernacle; the Table, and all its Veſſels: in ſhort, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing mentioned in this Chapter, and in the next alſo, and in the foregoing, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid to have made the Ark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he gave directions to the under Workmen, and ſaw them make it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he made the Table of Shittim-wood,</hi> &amp;c.] Next to the Ark, the Mercy-ſeat, and the Cherubims which belong to it; the Table and the Veſſels apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>AND he made the Altar of Burnt-offering,</hi> &amp;c.] Having given an Account of the making of all the Furniture of the Houſe, he proceeds to ſhow how all things were made without doors, with the ſame exactneſs, according to the Divine Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. All which <hi>Bezaleel</hi> could not make with his own hands; but he was chief Director in theſe things, as well as the reſt of the Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Five Cubits was the length thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] See XXVII. 1, 2, &amp;c. where this, and the ſix following Verſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he made the Laver of braſs,</hi> &amp;c.] See XXX. 18. where order is given for the making of this Laver, and its ſituation directed: but neither there, nor here are we told the figure or dimenſions of it; but have a particular remark, in this place, concerning
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:60246:356"/>the Materials out of which it was made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Looking glaſſes.</hi>] So we interpret the Hebrew word <hi>Maroth;</hi> becauſe now ſuch things are commonly made of <hi>Glaſs:</hi> but anciently of <hi>poliſhed Braſs;</hi> which they lookt upon as far better than Silver, for that made a weaker reflection, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> informs us, <hi>L.</hi> VII. <hi>c.</hi> 3. And the beſt of theſe <hi>Specula</hi> were, among the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> made at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> of Braſs and Tin mixed together, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, <hi>L.</hi> XXXIII. 9. XXXIV. 17. This ſhows the <hi>Laver</hi> was made of the fineſt and moſt pure Braſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Women aſſembling, which aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>] The Hebrew word <hi>Hattzobeoth</hi> ſignifies that they came by Troops to make this Preſent to the LORD. And the LXX. and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> underſtanding it, of ſuch Women as came together to ſerve God, by Faſting and Prayer (for there is the ſame word uſed in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 22.) moſt Interpreters think, they that made this Oblation, were very devout Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were wont to ſpend much time at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, where the Preſence of God was. For <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tent, ſerved inſtead of the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and was ſo called, till this Tabernacle was built, XXXIII. 7, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> alſo obſerves, upon theſe words; That theſe Women making a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will Offering of the Looking-glaſſes, wherein they were wont to behold the Beauty of their Faces, and to dreſs and adorn their Heads; it ſeems to argue their very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Mind, deſpiſing the Vanity of the World, and delighting far more in the Service of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And he made the Court,</hi> &amp;c.] All that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from this place to <hi>v.</hi> 21. is explained in the XXVII Chapter, from <hi>v.</hi> 9. to <hi>v.</hi> 20. except two or three words, which I ſhall here take notice of.</p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>The Chapiters of Silver.</hi>] There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Raſhim (Chapiters)</hi> in the XXVII Chapter; but only of <hi>Vauim</hi> (or <hi>hooks</hi>) which were of Silver, <hi>v.</hi> 10. &amp; 17. But this Verſe ſhows that thoſe hooks, were in the Chapiters, or Heads of the Pillars, out of which thoſe aroſe, as an Ornament to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And the heighth in the breadth,</hi> &amp;c.] This is an Hebrew Phraſe, ſignifying the height of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf: whoſe breadth when it lay along, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its height when it was hung up. And that was <hi>five Cubits;</hi> proportionable to the Hangings of the Court, which was five Cubits high, XXVII. 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>This is the ſum of the Tabernacle, even of the Tabernacle of the Testimony,</hi> &amp;c.] Some will have this relate to the fore-named things, mentioned in this and in the fore-going Chapters. But I take it rather to be a Preface to the Account which <hi>Moſes</hi> ordered to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all the Gold, Silver and Braſs that was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in building of the Tabernacle. Which being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, amounted to ſo many Talents as are mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 24, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Service of the Levites.</hi>] Rather, <hi>By the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Levites;</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed to take the Account of all the Expences.</p>

                  <hi>By the hand of</hi> Ithamar, <hi>Son to</hi> Aaron <hi>the Priest.</hi>] Under the Conduct of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Aaron;</hi> whom he appointed to preſide over the Levites, in taking this account.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And</hi> Bezaleel <hi>the Son of</hi> Uri, <hi>made all that the LORD commanded</hi> Moſes.] Which Gold, Silver and Braſs was committed into the hands of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> (though in the Preſence of all the reſt of the Workmen, XXXVI. 2, 3.) as the principal Perſon, who was to ſee it employed, in making every thing which the LORD commanded <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And with him was</hi> Aholiab, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Unto whom God joyned <hi>Aholiab</hi> as his Aſſociate in ſo great an Undertaking; who made uſe of ſeveral others, whom they taught in thoſe Arts, which God by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Inſpiration had made them to underſtand, XXXV. 30, 31, 34, 35.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>All the gold which was occupied for the work,</hi> &amp;c.] About the Ark, the Table, the Candleſtick, and all belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, XXXVII. 2, 11, 17, 24, 26. and about the holy Garments mentioned XXXIX. 5, &amp;c. 15, 25, 30.</p>
               <p>What was not employed about this work (for the People brought more than enough, XXXVI. 5, 7.) it is very probable was laid up in the Treaſury, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Uſes, as there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twenty and nine Talents, and ſeven hundred and thirty Shekels.</hi>] It hath been noted before, that a <hi>Shekel</hi> is near half a Crown of our Money: Now it is evident (from <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26.) that there were Three thouſand Shekels in a <hi>Talent;</hi> ſo that a Talent of Silver, as Dr. <hi>Cumberland,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> computes it (in his learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Scriptures of Weights and Meaſures, c.</hi> 4.) amounts to Three hundred fifty three pound, eleven ſhillings, and ſome odd pence, in our Money. And a Talent of Gold (reckoning Gold to be above fourteen times in value) to Five thouſand ſeventy Six pound, three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ten pence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And the Silver of them that were numbred of the Congregation was an hundred Talents, and a thouſand ſeven hundred and threeſcore and fifteen ſhekels,</hi> &amp;c.] There being Six hundred, and three thouſand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, that offered each of them half a Shekel (as the next Verſe tells us) they make Three hundred and one thouſand, ſeven hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five thouſand Shekels. Which amounting to an Hundred Talents, with 1775. Shekels more, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:60246:358"/>that a Talent contains Three thouſand Shekels. For no Number (as the ſame Learned Biſhop hath ſhown) but Three thouſand, dividing 301775. will produce an Hundred, and leave 1775 in Remainder.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>A Bekah for every man, that is half a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> &amp;c.] See XXX. 13. Some may poſſibly think it unaccountable, that ſo great Treaſures ſhould be found among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Deſert; and eſpecially that they ſhould be furniſhed with ſuch precious Stones, as are mentioned in the next Chapter <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they were before, XXVIII. 17, 18, &amp;c. But ſuch Perſons ſhould conſider, that their Anceſtors were very great Men, and had gathered great Riches, before they came into <hi>Egypt:</hi> where <hi>Joſeph,</hi> it is likely, left them no ſmall Treaſures: And though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perhaps ſqueezed them (as I ſaid upon Chapter the firſt) yet they preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt of their Riches, and were re-imburſed what they loſt, by what they borrowed of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> From whoſe dead bodies, thrown on the Sea-ſhore, we may well ſuppoſe they got ſtill more; as they did alſo from the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who being a People near to <hi>Arabia</hi> (from whence a great part of the precious Stones came) we may likewiſe ſuppoſe were not unfurniſhed with them. And beſides all this, they had <hi>Shittim-wood</hi> good ſtore in the Wilderneſs (as I noted Chap. XXV.) and ſome of the Jews, particularly <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> think it not improbable, that they traded with the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who bordered upon the Wilderneſs, while they continued in it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And of the hundred Talents of Silver were cast the Sockets of the Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c.] It appears by the XXVI Chapter, that there were juſt an Hundred of theſe Sockets, which were the Foundation of the Houſe of God, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 21, 25, 32. To the making of every one of which there went a Talent of Silver.</p>
               <pb n="709" facs="tcp:60246:358"/>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And of the thouſand ſeven hundred ſeventy five ſhekels, he made,</hi> &amp;c.] An hundred Talents being ſpent in making the Sockets, the Remainder, which was 1775 Shekels (<hi>v.</hi> 25.) was laid out upon Hooks, and Chapiters, and Fillets about the Pillers. Which make up the whole Account of the Silver.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>And the braſs of the Offering,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe gives an account of the value of the Braſs, which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple offered; as the former Verſes of the Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And therewith he made the Sockets to the Door of the Tabernacle, and the brazen Altar,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe and the next gives an Account how the Braſs was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, according to God's Order before-mentioned, XXVI. 37. XXVII. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And the Sockets of the Court,</hi> &amp;c.] See XXVII. 10, 17, 18, 19. Here is not ſuch a particular Account given, upon what things the Gold was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed (but only in general, <hi>in all the work of the holy place,</hi> v. 24.) becauſe all things that were not made of Silver and Braſs, were made of Gold; and a great deal, it appears by the next Chapters, was imployed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Aaron's</hi> glorious Attire.</p>

                  <hi>They made.</hi>] This ſhows how all that goes before (where it is ſaid <hi>he made</hi>) is to be interpreted. <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and all that were employed under them, had a hand (as we ſpeak) in theſe Garments: the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Artiſts directing, and the reſt working all that is here mentioned.</p>

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And they did beat the Gold into thin plates,</hi> &amp;c.] The under Workmen by <hi>Bezaleel</hi>'s direction, did firſt beat the Gold into very thin Plates, and then ſlice them into Wires, or ſmall Threds of Gold. For in thoſe days they had not the Art which we have now, of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of Gold into round Wires or Threds, of what length we pleaſe: but, as <hi>Moſes</hi> here deſcribes it, they beat it firſt into broad thin Plates, and then cut off leſſer, and narrower Wires (as we call them) which were not round, but of a very ſmall breadth; which they wove with the other Materials here mentioned. But nothing is here ſaid of Silver thus wrought; for they had not the Art of weaving Silver in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ancient times, as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> obſerves upon <hi>Vopiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Aurelian.</hi> In whoſe days the Art of making <hi>Silver</hi> into Threds, and weaving it with their Garments, was not known: but was much in uſe in the time of the latter <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours.</p>

                  <hi>To work it in blue, and in purple,</hi> &amp;c.] The manner of it was thus, (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith)
<q>They took one Thred of Wire of Gold, and joyned it with ſix Threds of <hi>blue,</hi> and twiſted all ſeven into one. And ſo they mingled the like Thred of Gold with ſix of <hi>purple;</hi> and another with ſix of <hi>ſcarlet,</hi> and another with ſix of <hi>fine linen:</hi> So that there were twenty eight Threds in all.</q> Which <hi>R.

For the Gold being ſtretched into a thin Plate, and Threds cut out of it, they weaved a Thred of Gold, with ſix Threds of <hi>Blue</hi> (and ſo they did with the reſt) after which they twiſted all theſe Threds into one.

So the Hebrews interpret it. None of them needed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, ſaith <hi>R.

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thus did</hi> Moſes; <hi>according to all that the LORD commanded him, ſo did he.</hi>] He took the ſame care in erecting the Tabernacle, and diſpoſing every thing in its place, that the Workmen had done in making all things according to God's mind, XXXIX. 43.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>And it came to paſs, in the first month,</hi> &amp;c.] This and the following Verſes, to Verſe 34. give an account of the Execution of what God commanded, in the foregoing part of this Chapter. But it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to reſolve, whether every thing was executed at this very time, or no. For full underſtanding of which, it will be neceſſary to mark diligently, the order wherein God requires all the foregoing Commands to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And firſt he bids him ſet up the Tabernacle, and put every thing belonging to it, in its place, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. and ſo forward to <hi>v.</hi> 9. And next to conſecrate it, and all the Veſſels thereof, with the Altar of Burnt-offerings and its Veſſels, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. And then to proceed to conſecrate <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15.
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:60246:363"/>Now it is expreſly here affirmed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did perform the firſt of theſe, that is, ſet up the Tabernacle, and put every thing appertaining to it, in its right place, on the firſt day of the firſt month, of the ſecond year after their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> At which time we muſt ſuppoſe alſo he began to conſecrate it, and ſpent ſeven days in the Conſecration of it and of the Altar of Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is appointed XXIX. 37. But the difficulty is to determine, when he conſecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, as he is here required, in which ſeven days were alſo ſpent as we read VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> Some think there were but ſeven days in all ſet apart for this work, and conſequently they were conſecrated together. So <hi>Torniellus</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> and <hi>Abulenſis</hi> before him, who follow <hi>Seder Olam</hi> and other Jewiſh Writers, who are of this Opinion. The ground of which is, that the Tabernacle being erected on the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the month before-mentioned, and its Conſecration finiſhed on the <hi>eighth,</hi> there was a Solemn Paſſover kept upon the <hi>fifteenth</hi> (IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which could not be held, they ſuppoſe, unleſs there were Prieſts to offer the Paſſover: who therefore were conſecrated at the ſame time with the Tabernacle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on the eighth day another buſineſs began, which was the offering made by the Princes of the Tribes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in their day, VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. But the principal ground is, that in VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>anointing</hi> (i. e. Conſecrating) <hi>the Altar,</hi> and of <hi>Conſecrating Aaron and his Sons,</hi> as done both at the ſame time. But there is a weighty Objection againſt all this; which is, that in the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, there were three Sacrifices offered upon the Altar, one for a Sin-offering, another for a Burnt-offering, and the Ram of Conſecration for a Peace-offering (VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.18, 22.) None of which could be acceptable for their Sanctification, till the Altar it ſelf was made
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:60246:363"/>holy. And therefore the ſeven days appointed for that purpoſe were ended, before the Conſecration of the Prieſts began, which continued ſeven days more; and then the next day was the Feaſt of unleavened Bread. Which was famous on a double account; firſt, becauſe it was the <hi>first</hi> day of unleavened Bread; and then it was the <hi>Octaves</hi> of the Conſecration. And this appears more plainly from I <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. where we find the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commands were given to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle by the Divine Majeſty; who therefore dwelt there, when he commanded the Prieſts to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which he did not, till the Tabernacle was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſecrated to be his Habitation. There the Prieſts alſo are commanded to abide during the ſeven days of their Conſecration, VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 33. which ſhows that all things belonging to its Sanctification were finiſhed, before their Conſecration began. As to that which is alledged from VIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. I ſhall conſider it there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And he ſpread abroad the Tent over the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi>] The <hi>Ohel,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Tent,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies the whole Houſe of God, (See <hi>v.</hi> 19.) but here only the external part of it, which covered that which was properly called <hi>Miſchchan</hi> [the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>].

XXXVI. 14, 19. So the Tabernacle was an Houſe within an Houſe; incloſed with ſtrong Walls (as we call them) to ſecure it from the injury of the Weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And put the covering of the Tent upon it.</hi>] Mentioned in XXVI. 14.</p>
               <pb n="720" facs="tcp:60246:364"/>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And he took and put the Teſtimony into the Ark.</hi>] The two Tables of Stone, as he had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, XXV. 16. which he mentions again in the repetition of the Law, X <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. Hence the Ark is called, the <hi>Ark of the Covenant or Teſtimony</hi> in the next Verſe, and <hi>v.</hi> 3. of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And he brought the Ark into the Tabernacle.</hi>] It is probable that he had placed the Ark, after it was made, in his own Tent, which for the preſent was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> and had the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the LORD in it, XXXIII. 7, 9. but now he brought it into this Tabernacle, which by God's order was prepared for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſet up the Vail of the Covering,</hi> &amp;c.] See <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And he put the Table in the Tent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> Here the whole Houſe is called the <hi>Ohel</hi> (or <hi>Tent</hi>) as I obſerved upon Verſe 19. But immediately the word <hi>Miſchchan</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>Tabernacle</hi>) is uſed as the moſt proper expreſſion for the inſide of the Houſe, as the other moſt properly denotes the outſide of it. All is made more clear in the 34th Verſe; where we read that <hi>the Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is the outſide of the Houſe; and the Glory of the LORD <hi>filled the Tabernacle</hi> within. Though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>v.</hi> 38. the Cloud is ſaid to be <hi>upon the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 36. it is ſaid to be <hi>over the Tabernacle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was over the Tent which covered it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And he lighted the Lamps before the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.] In this and all that follows, of burning ſweet Incenſe, <hi>v.</hi> 27. offering the Burnt-offering and Meat-offering, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Moſes</hi> acted as a Prieſt, appointed by an extraordinary Commiſſion from God, only for this time; that he might Conſecrate the Houſe of God, and the Prieſts that were to miniſter therein; which being done, his Prieſthood ceaſed. And he did all that is
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:60246:364"/>mentioned in theſe Verſes, when the Tabernacle was Conſecrated, and the Glory of the LORD had filled it; teſtifying the Divine Preſence to be there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And</hi> Moſes, <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons, waſhed their hands,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows that <hi>Moſes</hi> acted now as a Prieſt, and therefore waſhed himſelf before he went to Sacrifice at the Altar, as the Prieſt afterwards were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound to do, XXX. 19, 20, 21. But it muſt be underſtood, that neither this waſhing here ſpoken of, nor his offering Sacrifice, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 29. was till ſome days after this. See <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>So</hi> Moſes <hi>finiſhed the work.</hi>] And then anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tabernacle, and all contained in it, according to God's order, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. the execution of which, though now not here mentioned, in ſo many words, is expreſly ſaid to be on the ſame day that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſet up the Tabernacle, VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>Then a Cloud</hi> (or, then <hi>the Cloud</hi>) <hi>covered the Tent of the Congregation.</hi>] After it was anointed and ſanctified for the Divine Reſidence (and the Princes perhaps had alſo finiſhed that large Offering which we read VII <hi>Numb.</hi> was made on this day) God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fill this place with his glorious Preſence. For the cloudy Pillar, which deſcended upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tent, and ſtood there before the door of it, XXXIII. 9. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved now from thence and came hither; not ſtanding at the door of it in the form of a Pillar, but ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf all over the outſide of the Tabernacle, ſo that it was covered with it, as we read alſo IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Glory of the LORD filled the Tabernacle.</hi>] See <hi>v.</hi> 22. What God promiſed XXV. 8, 22. he now performed, notwithſtanding their Revolt from him, by worſhipping the Golden Calf. Which made him withdraw himſelf from them, XXXIII. 7, &amp;c. till upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s earneſt Interceſſion for them, and their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:60246:365"/>he graciouſly conſented to return to them, and abide among them, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, &amp;c. As now he did, by ſetling his glorious Preſence in this Tabernacle which was ſet up in the midſt of them. For whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes</hi> was removed a Mile or two from their Camp, XXXIII. 7. this Tabernacle was pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (a month after this, I <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.) in the midſt of their Camps, as we read II <hi>Numb.</hi> 2, 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>was not able to enter into the Tent of the Congregation.</hi>] For the Glory of the LORD ſhone ſo bright and ſo ſtrong, beyond all that it had ever done, that no Eye could look upon it. And it filled not only the moſt holy Place, but the whole Body of the Tabernacle; ſo that he durſt not adventure to come within it, tell he was called, I <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. After which time he ſeems to have had liberty to go in unto God, when he pleaſed, VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 89. IX. 8, 9. For after this great day, the Glory of the LORD retired into the moſt holy Place, within the Vail; and reſided conſtantly there, over the Ark of the Teſtimony: from whence he ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came to conſult him in the holy Place, See the fore-mentioned VII <hi>Numb.</hi> 89. Whence he is ſaid to <hi>dwell between the Cherubims;</hi> though on ſome occaſion, this Glory appeared without upon the Tabernacle (but over the Ark, it is likely) XVI <hi>Numb.</hi> 42. And ſo perhaps it did XI. 17, 25. and ſometimes at the door of the Tabernacle, XXXI <hi>Deut.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe the Cloud abode thereon, and the Glory of the LORD filled the Houſe.</hi>] The Cloud, and the Glory of the LORD were not two different things; but one and the ſame, as the Pillar of Cloud and of Fire were. For outwardly it was a Cloud, and inwardly a Fire: and accordingly here, the External part of it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Tabernacle without; while the Internal part
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:60246:365"/>ſhone in full Glory, within the Houſe. Thus it was upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to <hi>draw near to the thick Darkneſs where God was,</hi> XX. 21. That is, the Glory of the LORD was in that thick Darkneſs. And ſo we read before, that <hi>the Glory of the LORD appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cloud,</hi> XVI. 10. And ſo thoſe words are to be interpreted, XXIV. 16. <hi>The Glory of the LORD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode upon Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>and the Cloud covered it,</hi> (that is, covered <hi>the Glory of the LORD,</hi> not <hi>the Mount</hi>) <hi>ſix days.</hi> After which, on the ſeventh day, the Glory of the LORD broke through it, and appeared like <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire,</hi> in the ſight of all the People, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>And when the Cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>went onward in their journeys.</hi>] That is, the LORD (whoſe glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was in this Cloud) led and conducted them in all their Removals. And therefore they are ſaid to have <hi>journeyed at the commandment of the LORD:</hi> becauſe when the Cloud (wherein the LORD was) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, then they journeyed, IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 17, 18, 20, 23.</p>
               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>But if the Cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not, till the day that it was taken up.</hi>] They were wholly governed by its motions, and followed its directions.</p>
               <p>Ver. 38. <hi>For the Cloud of the LORD.</hi>] So it is called alſo in X <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. becauſe the Glory of the LORD was in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was upon the Tabernacle by day.</hi>] And ſo it was by Night, but then had another appearance, as it here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And fire was on it by night.</hi>] The <hi>Fire</hi> and the <hi>Cloud</hi> (as I ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 35.) were not different things; but the ſame Pillar which was dark by day, when there was no need of light, ſhone like fire by night, when the dark
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:60246:366"/>part of it could not be ſeen, to lead and conduct them. It appeared therefore like a Cloud by day, and turned the light ſide to them (which was bright as fire) by night, that they might march, if there were occaſion, by its direction both day and night. And thus it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed XIII. 21, 22. IX <hi>Numb.</hi> 15, 16, &amp;c. And ſo this Verſe may be tranſlated, <hi>The Cloud of the LORD was upon the Tabernacle by day, and the Fire was [bo] in it</hi> (i.e. in the Cloud) <hi>by night.</hi> For ſo they are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where deſcribed, as one within the other, V <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. <hi>The LORD ſpake unto all your Aſſembly out of the midst of the fire, of the Cloud, and of the thick Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſight of all the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>throughout all their journeys.</hi>] The whole Congregation had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly this comfortable Token of God's Preſence among them, by the Cloud in the day time, and Fire in the night: which never left them all the time they were in the Wilderneſs, but brought them to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
